psst. hi you
uh i know it says all rights reserved down there or whatever but lets be real im probably not gonna press charges if u steal something from this webzone. most of my contributions are what would fall under "facts" and "data" anyways which isn't something you can copyright. did you know you also cant copyright fashion or recipes?? yet the fashion industry and martha stewart or whoever the hell does cooking are still going strong without it. funny that
the way copyright law works is fuckin bullshit and if i was more confident id like. officially release this under some sort of CC license. CC is dope by the way. love you guys. do you guys know if i can like legally put in my will "hey when im dead release all my shit into the public domain" because that would be fairly ideal.
anyways as you may know all art and culture builds on each other nothing exists in a vacuum nothing is original trying to keep a strong indefinite grip on intellectual properties ends up badly for everyone except the big capitalists at the top. i am staring directly at disney. please release the public domain. if you guys try to start some shit in the next few years because mickey's due for release again im marching straight to la and you can catch these fucking hands listen i know you guys were mad about oswald back in the day but listen. listen. its been a century. the creators are all dead. listen. youre just being greedy capitalist pig assholes now. also you have a horrible monopoly on the entertainment industry
anyways uh maybe dont steal from the other people whose copyrights i have listed down there though; i can argue fair use for about 90% of the copyrighted material on this site but that's a legally defensible position not a right and you or i could very easily get our asses sued if big corporation man dont like us
(on the other hand my youtube channel has no defense; most of my videos have copyright claims resulting in demonetization so the money theoretically goes to mothy instead? is what i think happens? i dont monetize my channel anyways so thats a moot point maybe. i break copyright law daily its fun and enriching i do recommend supporting mothy if you can i link where you can find the albums on each of the pages and for the novels you just have to poke around a bit they're out there)

peace,

			<p>For on a dark night such as this, a <em>scary</em> bear comes out</p>
			<p>At long last I’ve found them, finally I’ve found them<br />I certain don’t want to do something like hand them over to anyone, to <em>anyone</em></p>
			<p>I run through a forest path where flowers bloom<br />While I’m carrying with me red fruits<br />If I return like this, he and I<br />Surely can become happy</p>
			<p>Later on however, a bear that<br />Made a scary face chases me<br />Please, forgive me<br />Please overlook me</p>
			<p>I knew that in truth, these fruits<br />Are that bear’s treasures</p>
		</div>
		<div class="right">
			<p>I run, a wandering run<br />I won’t hand over my happiness<br />The bear’s form is illuminated by the moon<br />Its dark shadow draws closer to me</p>
			<p>The correct path is already lost<br />But still I run, I only run<br />I cry, the bear was crying too<br />The two fruits were also crying</p>
			<p>At last I finally arrived, at my beloved home<br />He was kindly smiling, but<br />He saw the fruit I held<br />And made a very sad face</p>
			<p>“Listen, our children are already<br />Not in this world<br />Return these children<br />To their true mother’s side”</p>
			<p>Even if reality tore me apart someday<br />With its fangs and claws<br />Those warm, kind fruits<br />I wanted them at any cost</p>
			<p>God, with my own hands<br />I committed an unforgivable sin<br />“If you do it now you can start over”<br />He said that, but</p>
			<p>“That’s impossible! Because I already…”</p>
			<p>Lying down outside the house is the corpse of a lone woman<br />Nearby, full of milk, was a small glass bottle…</p>

Her fiancé Kiril Clockworker also used to be a “her”, but he was saved by her and is presently making a living as a craftsman of music boxes. There is also a rumor that she’s communicating with the Earth God Held, but as she has not once gone outside the Magic Kingdom up to this point, that’s impossible. Murdered in year 013 EC.</p>

Although she has not received any magical training, the results of an examination of all inhabitants by the Royal Research Institute confirmed that she holds a high density M factor, and she was selected as a candidate of the 7th Project “Ma”. Because the other three subjects died, she finally became the sole official “Ma” candidate, and has been impregnated with the god seed. However, due to the resurrection and rampage of the dragon god immediately afterward, her entire body was burned in flames, bringing her on the verge of death.</p>

They are unpleasant beings that are said to the be the reason why the Second Period (the world of the gods) perished, as well as laying waste to even the current world as criminals. Destined to be villains, while their rehabilitation is difficult it’s said that only a Lighwatch priestess can remove the malice gene from them. Almost all “ghoul children” (artificial humans) are also “her”s. The cause behind that is likely that the figure that is the origin of “ghoul children” is also the current world’s oldest “her”.</p>

They were sealed inside the white ark “Sin”, along with their six kin who followed them, by the sun god.</p>

			<p class="versebreak">Everyone around him kept their distance from him as such<br />So he was always<br />All alone</p>
			<p>Barisol’s daughter is an only child<br />A once-in-a-millennium child prodigy<br />Entering college at age six, she studies about the heart of man</p>
			<p>Unending crimes and wars; why do people hate each other so?<br />So that she could understand that even a little, she continued with her research</p>
			<p class="versebreak">And so she realized the cause of the unending ‘Malice’<br />She knew<br />‘That’s not in this world’</p>
			<p>Barisol’s son is an only child<br />He too finally took up a sweetheart, a maid his age who came to work for him<br />She was adorable like a doll</p>
			<p>“I’d like you to let me wear your clothes,”<br />One day he requested of her<br />While becoming terribly flustered<br />“That’s disgusting” was her only reply</p>
		</div>

			<p>Barisol’s daughter is an only child<br />She too was beginning to be violated by ‘Malice’<br />Having unending murder impulses without knowing why, she consulted with a colleague</p>

			<p>From outside the door was an angry voice<br />In a corner of the room, he was growing afraid<br />The doll strewn about inside the room, its limbs were warm and in pieces</p>
			<p class="versebreak">There was another world in the mirror that his eyes had been able to see<br />A woman who resembled himself extended a hand</p>
			<p>When the world was consumed by “Malice”, an ark flew into the cosmos<br />With a crew of 72 people, inside of that it’s said there were also twins</p>
			<p>……Just before she would kill ‘herself’, she realized the truth<br />That this was a clever trap that man had devised</p>
			<p>When I handle this myself, that really would be the entrance to ‘Malice’<br />With me fallen, he likely intended to ride on the ark in my place</p>
			<p>Barisol’s child is an only child<br />But nowadays they’re two children<br />An older sister knowing the heart of man and a younger brother knowing the body of man</p>

			<p>A prostitute drowned in sensuality<br />A noblewoman haughty with arrogance<br />A jealous girl in love with her brother<br />And that brother’s fiancée</p>

			<p>“After this you will be reborn, today is your Re_birthday”<br />With arms covered in burns, he touched<br />‘What used to be me’</p>
			<p>A light shines into the dark sky<br />Looking at it, I remember</p>
			<p>Yes, this was formerly such a song</p>
			<p class="versebreak">On the night of the full moon the experiment begins<br />If the era changes, then the song will change again too</p>
			<p>My heart hasn’t changed<br />My body became a red cat<br />I wouldn’t be dying anymore, but<br />I won’t be returning to human anymore either<br />Supposing I joined together two so that they became one<br />They couldn’t become double<br />What should I live for from now on?</p>
			<p>Before disappearing, he said<br />“I won’t return here again, continue with your experiments”</p>
		</div>
		<div class="right">
			<p>Seven lights scatter about in the southern sky<br />Looking at them, I remember</p>
			<p>Yes, I’ll live for retribution against the woman who stole everything!</p>
			<p class="versebreak">On the night of a new moon my revenge begins<br />If my body changes, my goal will change too</p>
			<p>Just like that person made me<br />This time I’ll turn people “evil”</p>
			<p>This song that I have heard somewhere<br />Eventually it’ll become a different song again won’t it?</p>

		<h3>Act 3 Song 2</h3>
		<h2>Tale of Abandonment on a Moonlit Night</h2>
		<div class="left">
			<p>Mother,<br />What kind of fortune does this path lead to?<br />Over there,<br />Will we be able to eat lots of our favorite snacks?</p>
			<p>Father,<br />Beyond this point is God waiting for us?<br />Why<br />Do you look at us with such sad faces?</p>
			<p>Inside the dark forest<br />We understood the whole truth<br />That if we continue in this way<br />We’ll soon be unable to return</p>
			<p>The two of us left all alone<br />Our names are Hänsel and Gretel<br />By the small light of the great moon<br />We don’t know the way home</p>
		</div>
		<div class="right">
			<p class="versebreak">We walk, a wandering walk<br />It doesn’t mean we don’t have a clue<br />A small glass bottle is lit up by the moon<br />The sparkling light illuminates the way<br />Nevertheless, we’ll walk<br />Without knowing whether this is the correct path<br />Finally we found it, and we understand<br />This is the witch’s house</p>
			<p class="versebreak">Come, let’s attack the evil witch<br />Cast her in the burning stove<br />When she’s gone<br />Surely we can become happy</p>
			<p>Hey mother, praise me<br />I defeated the evil witch</p>
			<p class="versebreak">Hey father, praise me<br />I defeated the witch’s henchman too</p>
			<p class="versebreak">At any rate<br />This is a really calming place, huh?<br />It feels as if though long ago,<br />We used to live here, doesn’t it?</p>
			<p>Come, let’s go meet our <em>real</em> mother and father</p>

		<h3>Act 3 Song 3</h3>
		<h2>Chrono Story</h2>
		<div class="left">
			<p>Is that the song of birds that I can hear?<br />No, that is the cry of the forest<br />Is that the light of the moon that’s shining?<br />No, that’s the burning fire</p>
			<p>The person we used to call “mother”<br />Turns to ashes inside the stove<br />The “Original Sin” that remained afterwards<br />We divided into seven with our own hands</p>
			<p>“Lust”, is the flower<br />“Gluttony”, is the seed<br />“Pride”, is the stone<br />“Envy”, is the spring<br />“Sloth”, is the wind<br />“Greed”, is the dirt<br />And,<br />“Wrath”, is the forest</p>
			<p>Fly away, seven sins<br />The impurity born from our false mother<br />Let the world turn and turn<br />This evil, grave sin<br />Purify it</p>
		</div>
		<div class="right">
			<p>By the hands of the forbidden fruit<br />The seven sins were released into the world<br />The tree of Held, who protects the forest,<br />Requests his friend to collect them all</p>
			<p>“I don’t mind if it kills some time”<br />“’Cause my time is infinite anyhow”<br />The sorceress sneers</p>
			<p>The eternity she was granted<br />At the end of having lost the one she loved<br />And destroyed what was precious<br />To her was nothing but emptiness</p>
			<p>The sorceress who obtained everything<br />And then lost it<br />What does she wish for?<br />What does she seek?<br />To the end of time…</p>
			<p>Born and raised from a lone woman<br />The story of such a sin cut into seven<br />The capricious whim of a witch who transcends time<br />This Chrono Story that begins from the forest</p>

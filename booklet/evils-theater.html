		<h3>The princess of Lucifer</h3>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Once upon a time<br />Reigning at the top<br />Of a fiendish kingdom was<br />A noble girl of age 14</p>
			<p>Luxurious and splendid furnishings<br />A servant whose face greatly resembled hers<br />A favorite horse named Josephine<br />Everything, everything was hers</p>
			<p>If there wasn’t enough money<br />Choke it from the ignorant masses<br />Those that would oppose me<br />Completely purge them</p>
			<p>“Come, kneel to me!”</p>
			<p>The flower of evil sweetly blooms<br />With brilliant color<br />The pitiful weeds around her<br />Indeed, they’ll turn to nourishment and rot away</p>
			<p>The tyrant princess was in love with<br />A blue man of across the sea<br />Though he fell in love at first sight<br />With a green woman in the neighboring country</p>
			<p>The princess, mad with jealousy<br />One day summoned her cabinet minister<br />And said in a quiet voice<br />“Send to ruin the kingdom of green”</p>
			<p>Many houses reduced to ashes<br />Many lives disappearing<br />The suffering people’s lamentations<br />Don’t reach the princess</p>
			<p>“Oh, it’s tea time”</p>
			<p>The flower of evil sweetly blooms<br />With maddening color<br />Although it’s a very lovely flower<br />Indeed, there are too many thorns to touch it</p>
			<p>To overthrow the evil princess<br />At last the people rose up<br />Leading the disorderly mob was<br />A female swordsman in red armor</p>
			<p>Their rage accumulated in conviction<br />Wrapped up the whole country<br />Soldiers tired from the long war<br />Weren’t a threat</p>
			<p>Finally they surrounded the palace<br />The retainers escaped<br />The adorable and lovely princess<br />At last was captured</p>
			<p>“You insolent thug!”</p>
			<p>The flower of evil sweetly blooms<br />With colors that seem sad<br />The paradise for her<br />Indeed will collapse, brittle and transient</p>
			<p>Once upon a time<br />There was a noble girl of age 14<br />Who reigned at the top<br />Of a fiendish kingdom</p>
			<p>The time of her execution was 3 PM<br />A time when church bells would ring<br />That person who was called princess<br />What did they think, alone in jail?</p>
			<p>Finally that time arrived<br />The bells signaling the end ring<br />Without taking notice of the crowd<br />She said</p>
			<p>“Oh, it’s tea time”</p>
			<p>The flower of evil pitifully scatters<br />With brilliant color<br />Afterwards, people will say<br />Indeed, she was certainly the Daughter of Evil</p>

		<h3>His significance of existence</h3>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p class="versebreak">You are the princess, I am a servant<br />Fate divided, miserable twins<br />I’ll protect you, if it’s for that<br />I will even become evil</p>
			<p>We were born in high expectations<br />Blessed by the church bells<br />By the arbitrary circumstances of adults<br />Our futures were split into two</p>
			<p>Even if all the world<br />Becomes your enemy<br />Because I will protect you<br />You should keep on smiling</p>
			<p class="versebreak">You are the princess, I am a servant<br />Fate divided, miserable twins<br />I’ll protect you, if it’s for that<br />I will even become evil</p>
			<p>While on an outing to the neighboring country<br />In town I happened upon that green haired girl<br />I fell in love at first sight<br />With that kind voice and smile</p>
			<p>But if the princess<br />Asks me to erase that girl<br />I shall answer that<br />Why? These tears won’t stop</p>
			<p>You are the princess, I am a servant<br />Fate divided, maddened twins<br />“Today’s treat is brioche”<br />You laugh, you innocently laugh</p>
			<p>This country may end very soon<br />At the hands of its crazed people<br />If it’s said this is our punishment<br />I shall take it upon myself to oppose it</p>
			<p>“Look, I’ll loan you my clothes”<br />“Wear them and escape immediately”<br />“It’s alright, we’re twins.”<br />“I’m sure no one will know”</p>
			<p class="versebreak">I am the princess, you are a fugitive<br />Fate divided, sorrowful twins<br />If it’s said that you’re evil<br />Then that same blood runs in me too</p>
			<p>Once upon a time<br />I had a very precious sibling<br />Who reigned at the top<br />Of a fiendish kingdom</p>
			<p>Even if all the world<br />Becomes your enemy<br />Because I will protect you<br />Keep smiling somewhere</p>
			<p>(Finally that time arrived<br />The bells signaling the end ring<br />Without taking notice of the crowd<br />You speak my favorite phrase)</p>
			<p class="versebreak">You are the princess, I am a servant<br />Fate divided, miserable twins<br />I’ll protect you, if it’s for that<br />I will even become evil</p>
			<p>If only we could be reborn<br />Let’s play again then, okay?</p>

		<h3>Clockwork lullaby ZERO</h3>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>For the first time I learned the word called mom<br />For the first time I memorized the word called dad</p>
			<p>For the first time I learned the word called wind<br />For the first time I memorized the word called water</p>
			<p>For the first time I learned the word called friend<br />For the first time I memorized the word called dream</p>
			<p>Around the time I memorized the word called love<br />I learned the shape of the world</p>
			<p>For example, to convey what I’m feeling now<br />What sort of words would be correct?<br />Only to know that simple answer,<br />I’ll determinedly continue my wordplay</p>
			<p>For the first time I learned the word called lie<br />For the first time I memorized the word called wound</p>
			<p>For the first time I learned the word called sin<br />For the first time I memorized the word called retribution</p>
			<p>Around the time I memorized the word called evil<br />I learned the darkness of the world</p>
			<p>For example, when you abandoned me<br />What sort of words would apply?<br />In order to learn an answer I don’t want to know<br />Let’s continue my wordplay for some ways yet</p>
			<p>For example, to convey what I’m feeling now<br />What sort of words would be correct?<br />Good morning, good day, thank you, farewell<br />I’ll determinedly continue my wordplay</p>
			<p>I will be here no matter what<br />Teach me words as always</p>

		<h3>Clockwork lullaby I</h3>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Teach me words as always<br />And I will change them into a song</p>
			<p>What did you obtain in a delusion?<br />Only one song of truth</p>
			<p>Lulila lulila, this singing voice<br />To whose side will it reach?<br />Obtaining a key called words<br />And opening the gates of the unknown</p>
			<p>I carried in both hands the toy I had requested, and thus obtained<br />And threw it out the window</p>
			<p>Humans who are never satisfied<br />What do you wish for, what will you achieve?<br />If you’re worn out, now simply<br />Sleep</p>
			<p>Lulila lulila, can this lullaby<br />Heal your heart, I wonder?<br />Carrying a sin called desire<br />And right now still dreaming</p>
			<p>Lulila lulila, this singing voice<br />Is the clockwork lullaby<br />If you don’t turn me<br />I’ll stop forever</p>
			<p>The flower-like memories<br />And even the mud-like traumas<br />They continue to turn and melt<br />All of it inside of me.</p>

			<p>Inside the dark forest<br />We understood the whole truth<br />That if we continue in this way<br />We’ll soon be unable to return</p>
			<p>The two of us left all alone<br />It’s like Hänsel and Gretel<br />By the small light of the great moon<br />We don’t know the way home</p>
			<p class="versebreak">We walk, a wandering walk<br />It doesn’t mean we don’t have a clue<br />A small glass bottle is lit up by the moon<br />The sparkling light illuminates the way<br />Nevertheless, we’ll walk<br />Without knowing whether this is the correct path<br />Finally we found it, and we understand<br />This is the witch’s house</p>
			<p>Come, let’s attack the evil witch<br />Cast her in the burning stove<br />When she’s gone<br />Surely we can become happy</p>
			<p>Hey mother, praise me<br />I defeated the evil witch</p>
			<p class="versebreak">Hey father, praise me<br />I defeated the witch’s henchman too</p>
			<p class="versebreak">At any rate<br />This is a really calming place, huh?<br />It feels as if though long ago,<br />We used to live here, doesn’t it?</p>

			<p>Worrying about me who can’t walk, you<br />Completely filled up the room with beautiful things for me</p>

		<h3>Clockwork lullaby III</h3>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>When I woke, I was alone<br />In a room smeared black<br />Not able to see, not able to hear<br />I tremble alone in the dark</p>
			<p>In the ceiling there’s a big hole<br />Looking closely, there’s a huge spring in there<br />From beyond that, there suddenly resounds<br />A ghastly, mysterious voice</p>
			<p>"Sinful boy<br />From this point on you will never<br />Be brought from this room"</p>
			<p>It said</p>
			<p>In that moment I recalled all of my memories<br />The many sins piled upon myself<br />Along with the reason I’m here, in the end I realized<br />That I can’t return to back then anymore</p>
			<p>When I came to, both my arms were clad in red manacles<br />That is surely the color of someone’s spilled blood<br />As for both my ankles, they have blue colored chains<br />That is surely the color of someone’s tears</p>
			<p>"Lulila lulila", the song I came to hear<br />I wonder who is singing this lullaby…?</p>
			<p>How much time has passed?<br />I asked of the unmoving spring<br />Only the singing voice<br />That I’m hearing out of nowhere heals me</p>
			<p>One day I realized<br />The true meaning of that song<br />And I added on new words<br />To the lullaby</p>
			<p>From a gap in the spring<br />A small light fell down<br />This is, surely</p>
			<p>―A message you sent me―</p>
			<p>The spring that began to turn recites quietly<br />“Your sins will never be forgiven”<br />But a word called water, a word called evil<br />We shall change those into a song</p>
			<p>The red manacles fall off and address me<br />“After this you will be reborn”<br />The blue shackles fall off and talk to me<br />“Today is your new Birthday”</p>
			<p>Everything spins and dyes white</p>
			<p>I’ll go to see you very soon</p>

		<h3>ANOTHER WORLD</h3>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Where was here, I wonder?<br />Who was I, I wonder?<br />I unroll a colorless map<br />To the south, to the south</p>
			<p>Where did she go off to, I wonder?<br />Who was “she”, I wonder?<br />I’m searching for a person I don’t know at all<br />To the north, to the north</p>
			<p>At an intersection built at someone’s whim<br />If we didn’t notice, we would have passed through<br />“Good day” “Good day”<br />“Nice to meet you” “Nice to meet you”<br />“How are you?”</p>
			<p class="versebreak">Highly similar but a little different, such a pair<br />That they met in this way could also be some kind of fate<br />Having stopped a bit, is having a chat<br />Something we can go do here as well? With the two of us</p>
			<p>The town is already far over the horizon<br />The one I met was<br />While like “a mirrored image”<br />She’s a different me</p>
			<p>Same appearance, same ribbon<br />Even if we secretly switch places<br />People probably wouldn’t find out, huh?<br />Together we laughed</p>
			<p>In the south I was a student<br />In the north I ruined a country<br />Happy things, sad things<br />One by one we tell each other them<br />In the end, let’s laugh</p>
			<p class="versebreak">Highly similar but a little different, if such a world<br />Met in this way, would something change?<br />With our personalities we choose different paths<br />But that isn’t a mistake either</p>
			<p>the worlds just cross<br />The worlds just gone<br />it is simply foreordination<br />no reason for us<br />but we are here<br />so “nice to see you”</p>
			<p class="versebreak">we’re just alike<br />we’re not the same<br />it is simply you and me<br />no reason for us<br />but we are here<br />“it’s time to go”</p>

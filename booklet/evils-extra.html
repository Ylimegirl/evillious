		<p>As of now, Arte had hardly any memories of her “true father”. However, at the least she knew well today that he wasn’t a tidy man.</p>
		<p>They would need to clean up the messy theater’s second floor before they set out on their journey. “Just what I was hoping for,” Arte murmured. She had once worked at a palace much larger than this. Cleaning was her specialty, and this interim body Lich had given her was functioning well right now.</p>
		<p>Useless Pollo peeked out from the mountain of junk. He had a black disk in his left hand, grinning with a smile that seemed to say, “I’ve found a treasure!”. Gretel took it from him, and went to immediately hock it in the trash bag she was carrying, but when she saw what was written on the center of the disk her hand stilled.</p>
		<p>“Genesis Girl Gretel”; that was Arte’s old name. After she and Pollo searched the mountain of junk together they were able to find several similar disks and a device that could play them: a jukebox.</p>
		<p>That there might be some essential secret hidden here…… didn’t seem likely. If there had been, Seth probably would not have entrusted cleaning the place to them.</p>
		<p>Even so, feeling a little curiosity, the girl opened the jukebox without hesitation.</p>
		<p>Seth and Ron were likely both in the “fat man’s room” on the first floor. No sound would make it through those massive walls. Probably.</p>
		<p>Arte put the disks inside, and pressed the switch on the jukebox.</p>

		<h3>Arte’s Theme</h3>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>The ruined world will someday be reborn<br />The seed embedded in the witch’s belly divided<br />One of the fragments the malice gave birth to<br />Her name is “Gretel”</p>
			<p>To birth something<br />You have to kill<br />Whether a parent or the world<br />On this journey of samsara, each time she repeats<br />She loses her memories</p>
			<p>At various critical points in history<br />She appears<br />First was the hope of salvation<br />In a kingdom to the north; a Twin of God<br />The second was an ill-mannered<br />Maid of Gluttony in a country to the south<br />She killed the parents who raised her<br />And killed the steward who saved her</p>
			<p>The third time she appeared<br />She was again a maid, in a central country<br />But her true identity<br />Was a spy from the sea who disrupts order<br />She murdered her birth mother<br />And disappeared from history<br />She now waits inside the glass<br />For the time of Genesis that will come someday</p>
			<p>On a night dark with the new moon<br />Gretel will appear<br />What does she see, her eyes sunk into darkness?</p>
			<p class="versebreak">If you yourself were<br />Her parent<br />Then whether you’re saved or not depends on you</p>
			<p>Failure gods, mirrors that don’t reflect one’s appearance<br />Though they’re useless and irrelevent<br />To this world’s fate,<br />They are essential beings</p>
			<p>She figures the day will probably come<br />Where they’ll be killed by what they had birthed too<br />And by her side<br />He was always there</p>
			<p>“Gretel” has “Hänsel”<br />Servants who wander the graveyard<br />They bid farewell to the world of the dead<br />And search for new possibilities<br />“Adam” stands by “Eve”<br />The Original Sinner who gives judgment<br />To right their mistakes<br />They’ll start over once more from the beginning</p>
			<p>“Amostia” has no one<br />The little boy who is the symbol of destruction<br />He’ll probably continue<br />To desperately seek out a counterpart<br />“Riliane” and “Allen”<br />Are together Servant and Daughter of Evil<br />From the black box they create<br />Their own personal utopia</p>
			<p>Any Genesis<br />May come to the world<br />That certainly<br />Can’t be avoided</p>
			<p class="versebreak">The established beginning<br />Or the distorted Irregular<br />“Sin” will be handed to all equally</p>
			<p>Crossing the time span of a millennium<br />Gretel will appear<br />While not knowing her own destiny</p>
			<p>Whether she’ll become an angel<br />Or an insane familiar<br />That depends on you standing before her eyes</p>

			<p>The people swarm to the messengers<br />Seeking salvation<br />They tried to make them sing<br />The tunes that pleased them<br />The messengers never refuse<br />They’ll sing any song<br />For that is<br />Their mission</p>
			<p>The mirrors continue to reflect humanity’s true nature<br />Eventually the messengers lost their wings</p>

			<p>If we seem to be evil<br />That is surely your own form<br />We are little more than infinity mirrors<br />Mirrors that reflect the truth</p>
			<p>Come, let’s sing and dance together<br />Continue to let out your desire<br />The melody echoes and resounds together<br />Please believe in the divine protection of the infinity mirrors</p>

			<p>One day you disappeared<br />I searched but you weren’t anywhere<br />I desperately<br />Cry your name</p>
			<p>While dragging along my long body<br />I was raspily bawling<br />Will I never<br />Be able to see you again?</p>
			<p>Against my instincts<br />I had been looking forward to your growing up</p>

			<p>Before long I might head out<br />To that spring</p>
			<p>I peer into the spring<br />And the figure I see there<br />Is a repulsive one-eyed snake<br />I have known<br />That you and I<br />Would never be joined</p>

			<p>Tonight too with a wish in her heart<br />She reaches for the stars</p>
			<p>Abandoned by our parents<br />We were raised in an orphanage that could see the ocean<br />The one who raised us was<br />An old nun<br />She was very kind<br />And was always happily smiling<br />Though it was a poor life<br />All of us were happy</p>
			<p>One day she fell to illness<br />The day she’d be summoned to the stars drew near<br />At her bedside<br />We said to her:<br />You’ve raised us so well up until now<br />We want to repay you for that<br />However absurd, it doesn’t matter<br />Isn’t there something you wish for?</p>
			<p>She sweetly smiled<br />Like this, she came to respond<br />I am always waiting<br />Waiting for a reply to my letter<br />I sent it one day when I was young<br />A letter that I don’t know<br />Whether it arrived<br />Or not</p>
			<p class="versebreak">If my wish comes true<br />If my sins are forgiven<br />I want a reply to that letter<br />I will wait for it</p>
			<p>She laughs, it’s a wish that can’t be granted<br />Please forget it<br />And didn’t even tell us<br />Who she sent the letter to<br />We all divide our work up<br />And searched all over the country<br />And we found an old painter<br />Who knew her past</p>
			<p>The old man tells the truth<br />She once killed people<br />Many people became unhappy<br />Many people shed tears<br />The person who died for her sins<br />Was the recipient of her letter<br />The reply won’t come</p>
			<p>Even so she’ll wait, won’t she?<br />Even after her body has rotten away<br />Surely she will wait<br />Until the reply comes</p>
			<p>Finally that time arrived<br />The church bells signal the end<br />I press inside her wrinkled hand<br />One sheet of parchment</p>
			<p>That was a fake reply to the letter<br />That I wrote yesterday<br />After she’d read it through<br />In the end she said, “Thank you”</p>
			<p>The sorrowful wish fades to the stars<br />She had that same smile as always<br />Our realization of her sin was always<br />After everything was over</p>

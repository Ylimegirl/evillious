		<h2>Lucifenia Trinity</h2>

		<h2>―Leonhart―</h2>
		<p>That king was born from mud. And those who served him became a heroic trinity.</p>
		<p>Leonhart Avadonia was born in the red empire of Beelzenia. The young knight loved, of all people, the queen of the enemy country. In order to help her, she with such a lovely appearance, Leonhart fled from the country where he was born and raised. Called a prodigy, before his swordsmanship none of his pursuers were anything special. He cut down three, four…… and then his fifth foe, and then saw the bare face that was hidden under his disguise. Leonhart realized for the first time that the opponent he’d killed was his true younger brother. It was a reckless and blind love. And its ultimate end result was this. It was too late for regrets. While wearing red armor stained in blood, Leonhart escaped safely to the kingdom of Lucifenia. And then he swore his allegiance to its king, Arth, and the king’s wife, Anne.</p>
		<p>The first Hero was a red lion knight. This is the story of how he came to be.</p>

		<h2>A Hero's Armor is Always Crimson</h2>
		<h3>The Daughter Of Red</h3>
		<div class="left">
			<p>In a town that fell to ruin at the end of a battle<br />A lone knight walks through<br />He'd earned more military gains than anyone<br />He'd killed more people than anyone</p>
			<p>The people of the enemy nation fear his form<br />And they desperately beg for their lives<br />But he never<br />Grants their wish</p>
			<p>A woman's corpse tightly held<br />An innocently smiling baby<br />With cold eyes<br />He lifted his sword</p>
			<p>A hero's armor is always crimson<br />That is surely the color of the spilled blood he basked in<br />Even if these are deeds for someone's sake<br />Can you call that “justice”?</p>
			<p>Five years flowed on since then<br />And the battle continues today<br />Waiting for the knight at a temporary home<br />Is a lone, sweet girl</p>
			<p>Back then he'd noticed stitched on her clothes<br />Was the Imperial family's crest<br />If he had her on hand, one day<br />She might be useful as a hostage</p>
			<p>Foolish, innocent girl<br />Who smiles and says “Welcome home, Dad”<br />You do this even though I myself am the one<br />Who killed your parents</p>
			<p>A hero's armor is always crimson<br />That is surely the same color as his treachery<br />Even if these are deeds for someone's sake<br />Can you call that “justice”?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="right">
			<p>On the battlefield<br />Various things are<br />Running rampant<br />Victory, defeat, hatred, chance luck<br />And betrayal<br />Before he knew it, the knight<br />Was surrounded by a great many enemies<br />It was obvious that<br />They weren't ordinary soldiers</p>
			<p>“Quietly submit to us that girl,”<br />Urged an old woman in black clothes<br />If he complied,<br />They would probably murder her<br />But for the knight<br />That must have been a desired outcome<br />Because it was for that reason<br />He'd been keeping her until now</p>
			<p>There was someone who held a sword<br />And stood in front of the knight to protect him<br />A small, trembling back<br />It was the young child</p>
			<p>Pitiful girl<br />You do this even though the one you love as a father<br />Was just about to try selling you off</p>
			<p>After the knight gently patted the girl's head<br />He faced the assassins and drew his sword……</p>
			<p>A hero's armor is always crimson<br />That is surely the color of the twilight he basked in<br />Walking hand-in-hand in that bloodstained era,<br />Is a knight and a girl</p>
			<p>On the battlefield there is neither justice nor evil<br />The day of atonement will come someday<br />Until that time finally arrives<br />He's decided to be a “father”</p>

		<h2>―Mariam―</h2>
		<p>That king was born from mud. By the prank of Lich, a black Rollam bird spirit.</p>
		<p>Mariam Phutapié is not her real name. The girl had lost her memories of when she was young, she was endowed with frighteningly adept combat skills. At merely nine years old Mariam became a general of the country of Asmodean. Her true power was such that even her colleague, the cursed swordsman Gast Venom who was strongest in the world, was outdone by her. ……The reason why she betrayed Asmodean and crossed over to Lucifenia is uncertain. However, the man who had been her executive officer of the force that Mariam commanded, the “Silver Sparrow Unit”, shared this testimony: “Sometimes, she would have nightmares”, “And with an agonized expression she’d murmur these words in her sleep:”</p>
		<p>‘Abyss’, ‘red cat’, and ‘Project N’</p>
		<p>Is it a mere coincidence that an old woman in black clothes taking with her a red cat was sighted in Asmodean’s Misty Mountain Range during that same period?</p>
		<p>The second Hero was a silver assassin. There are still yet many mysteries surrounding her.</p>

		<h2>Neomaria of the Inverted Gravestone</h2>
		<h3>Prototype N</h3>
		<div class="left">
			<p>That girl, someone raised by a witch<br />A silver sparrow, the “Neomaria of the inverted gravestone”<br />To simply kill people without emotion<br />That was her doctrine, the doctrine of the witch of chaos</p>
			<p>Everything was an experiment, and also a beginning<br />The one to prefix “N”, a prototype assassin<br />Her entire family had been burned up by blue flames<br />The isolated girl carried a “seed of malice”</p>
			<p>A caravan<br />Advancing on an eastern desert<br />Suddenly<br />Disappeared one day<br />That was<br />Her first job<br />The assassin’s dagger of the inverted gravestone</p>
			<p>A girl who had her name<br />Etched into a gravesite by birth</p>
			<p>That girl, a murderer doll<br />Today’s target, a red garbed fugitive<br />Who betrayed his country, and killed his sibling<br />The witch told her “Promptly erase him”</p>
			<p>At the top of a cliff, she ambushes her target<br />The marked red clothes showed themselves<br />A boy who wasn’t that much older than her<br />For the first time some slight feelings of doubt were born in her</p>
			<p>Her feet slipped<br />She fell from the cliff<br />Her consciousness<br />Gradually blurred<br />The boy wearing red<br />Drew closer<br />He<br />Had his sword drawn</p>
		</div>
		<div class="right">
			<p>A girl who had her name<br />Etched into a gravesite by birth</p>
			<p>When she woke up she’d lost her memories<br />The girl stopped in the wasteland, on her body the traces of medical care<br />Eventually she was picked up by a traveling group<br />That was the carriage of a chivalric order who belonged to a certain country</p>
			<p>She forgot<br />Both her sins and her malice<br />And walked along<br />A new life<br />Relying on<br />Her faint memories<br />She went by the name<br />Of “Mariam”</p>
			<p>A girl who had her name<br />Etched into a gravesite by birth</p>
			<p>But there’s no one now<br />Who knows that name</p>

		<h2>―Elluka―</h2>
		<p>That king was born from mud. And always beside him was the figure of the one he loved.</p>
		<p>The existence of the Beelzenian Empire’s staff officer, Elluka Clockworker, was the Kingdom of Lucifenia’s greatest threat. Before the strange arts she could wield, even their forged, elite executive officers were meaningless. The end result was that Leonhart’s strong sword, and Mariam’s magnificent throwing knives were both sent flying in the windstorm that Elluka had created. Even worse, Gast, the mercenary banished from Asmodean, was brought along as her bodyguard. The soldiers lost their fighting spirit. In order to boost their morale, finally the king of Lucifenia, Arth, stood before Elluka holding his own sword. But Elluka did not try to fight him, and disappeared towards the Millenium Tree Forest to the northwest. One week after that Elluka appeared on Sanosun Bridge before Arth and Anne, and Leonhart and Mariam. And she, as though it was perfectly natural, aspired to become a follower of the Kingdom of Lucifenia.</p>
		<p>The third Hero was an eternal sorceress. She was always whimsical.</p>

		<h2>Swear an Oath on that Bridge</h2>
		<h3>Clockwork Lullaby 9</h3>
		<div class="left">
			<p>I can’t rewind time<br />The gears will turn on<br />Until<br />The spring snaps</p>
			<p>These days where I stave off boredom<br />That’s just what life is<br />That’s what I thought<br />What I thought</p>
			<p class="versebreak">In the vicinity of that bridge<br />I met you all<br />And something changed<br />The mere whim of<br />A rebellious witch<br />…Probably<br />We assemble around an eccentric king<br />Unsteady heroes<br />The words of our vow<br />Even those in pieces</p>
			<p>If you have any troubles<br />I’ll at least give you advice<br />Because I’m currently<br />Pointlessly leading a long life</p>
			<p>The bridge connects this great land<br />As well as people’s hearts<br />Surely that’s so<br />…Maybe that’s so</p>
		</div>
		<div class="right">
			<p class="versebreak">A moderate suggestion<br />Everyone laughs<br />I laughed too<br />Surely even something like fate<br />Can be changed<br />…Probably<br />We all have our own way, but we are the trinity<br />That’s all we need<br />The river flows on<br />And we too continue forward</p>
			<p class="versebreak">From a bat fluttering in the sky<br />I came to hear a song of the spring…</p>
			<p>In the vicinity of that bridge<br />I met you all<br />And something changed<br />The mere whim of<br />A rebellious witch<br />…Probably<br />We assemble around an eccentric king<br />Unsteady heroes<br />The words of our vow<br />Even those in pieces</p>
			<p>A clumsy knight<br />A scary-eyed assassin<br />A bath-hating witch<br />Surely even fate<br />Can be changed<br />…Probably<br />We all have our own way, but we are the trinity<br />That’s all we need<br />Right now, we<br />Swear an oath on that bridge</p>

	<p>That king was born from mud. But there was hardly anyone who knew that.<br /><br />The carriage that the Lucifenian King and his family were riding in had an accident near the Millenium Tree Forest. They made an error and fell from a cliff.</p>
	<p>It is largely believed that the king and queen died and that their son, Prince Arth, was the only survivor. Arth succeeded the crown at a young age and took action towards the unification of the Evillious region, his dearest wish.<br /><br />The only one who noticed a very slight change in Arth was his fiancée, Anne.</p>

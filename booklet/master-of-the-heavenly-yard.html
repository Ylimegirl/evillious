		<p>Right now I’ll tell you, as plainly as I can, what’s happening in this world.</p>
		<p>I died. You died. Along with the world. Because of <span class="red">Nemesis</span>…… because that dictator pressed the firing switch on that weapon of mass destruction. I can’t blame Bruno’s failure regarding that. Because I’m sure that even if he had been successful in obliterating her, our destruction would have just happened because of some other person.</p>
		<p>The problem is why we’re all continuing to remain suspended here on the ground world. We don’t have our bodies anymore. That much is obvious. Why is it obvious? Well right now you’re not a “tiger”——you have the appearance of a lovely young man. The deep wrinkles etched into my arms and legs have disappeared, and my skin is smooth. To the both of us these are the “ideal appearances” that we’d wanted, I’m certain it has something to do with that.</p>
		<p>There’s something more surprising than that. I saw my father again, for the first time in a long time. My father, who died several decades ago…… when I was young. Dad told me his hypothesis. It was crazy, and yet I also can’t help but believe in it. “We are all spirits,” he said. The weapon of mass destruction, “Punishment”, had even destroyed the boundary between heaven and the hellish yard. So the spirits of the dead all lost their place to go, and are flooding the ground world.</p>
		<p>So what happens now? I don’t know that. But…… there has been some slight unrest. Souls wearing the uniforms of Tasan Elphegort’s military are amassing in a certain place. It’s the area around the theater that’s floating in the air. How’s a building floating? How am I supposed to know that? Probably just that this world is “anything goes” now. Addressing them at the center of it all was the man who went by the name of the “gardener”——I’ve seen him before. <span class="red">Gammon Octo</span>. The man who was the leader of the Tasan Party before Nemesis. I might have to investigate a little more.</p>
	</figure>
	<figure id="p03" class="g02 right">
		<p>……I don’t really have any desire to take revenge on Gallerian, you know? In the first place, everyone’s already dead anyway. I have no interest in doing so. That’s why I let <em>her</em> go, too. ——Nemesis. I saw her together with a golden-haired boy. ……If my eyes were working right…… she had a “body”. What an unfunny joke. The perpetrator of the world’s destruction nonchalantly surviving like that. Though I don’t know if Nemesis considers that a good thing or not.</p>
		<p>As for the boy? Dad said something like, ‘isn’t that the one who was once the servant who served <span class="red">Princess Riliane</span> of Lucifenia, <span class="red">Allen Avadonia</span>?’ You don’t know him? Yeah, this was the first time I met him too. He was from a period centuries before mine, after all. It seems that the spirits of great figures and villains from history have been appearing on the ground world, huh? When I went to the ruined site of Lucifenia I just had to laugh. ‘Cause the “Daughter of Evil” Riliane, and the hero who defeated her, <span class="red">Germaine</span>, were partying together like pals. If you searched all over the world, you’d probably meet up with your ancestors, too, don’t you think?</p>
		<p>Like I said earlier, I’m going to try heading to that theater one more time. ——Yeah, you’re coming too huh? I don’t mind. We’ve been inseparable for a long time now after all.</p>
		<p class="versebreak">……Wait a minute.<br />What the heck is that black box——</p>

			<h3>[1. Epilogue]</h3>
			<p>We have done nothing but<br />Make mistakes<br />During these thousand years</p>
			<p>A wish of “if only”<br />Will never be granted now<br />Punishment has been passed down</p>
			<p>You several hundred million souls<br />You several hundred million villains</p>
			<p>Is this unhappy conclusion someone’s fault?<br />Those who think so are all “sons of bitches”</p>
			<p>In the end<br />Have we left something behind?<br />In this thousand year journey</p>
			<p class="versebreak">The answer will surely<br />Never come forward<br />So I will go to see you</p>
			<h3>[2. The Hunt for the Deadly Sins]</h3>
			<p>In the center of the ruined world<br />A theater floats in the wasteland<br />The dead spirits gather together<br />And worship a black box</p>
			<p>Their master, the male gardener,<br />Gives orders to the souls<br />There are things they need to do<br />In order to save the world</p>
			<p>Destroy the souls possessed by demons<br />Kill the cause of everything, the “deadly sin contractors”</p>
			<p>His spirit followers start to move<br />“The hunt for the Deadly Sins” has now begun</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
			<h3>[3. The Princess Sets Out]</h3>
			<p>Before the princess<br />Are her deeply sleeping ministers<br />That is a “gift” from someone<br />The one who could protect her<br />Is gone now<br />The gardener’s troops approach</p>
			<p>The nun that appeared riding a white horse<br />Helps get the princess away<br />Towards a new journey</p>
			<p>I'm fed up<br />With just waiting<br />I hate always being protected<br />If I accomplish everything<br />All on my own<br />I’ll puff up my chest with pride<br />And go to see you</p>
			<h3>[4. The Heroes]</h3>
			<p>“Just what in the world is evil?”<br />The ones burdened with the seven sins<br />Should have been destroyed along with the world<br />But they are still<br />Living</p>
			<p>Can sins never be forgiven?<br />There is one who raised her voice<br />To stop the gardener’s ambitions<br />The heroes and the commoners<br />Take up phantom swords</p>
			<p>Justice, and evil,<br />Let’s change all of it into a song<br />Because punishment has already been handed down<br />So now is the time<br />Where we shall fight<br />So that our mistakes don’t repeat again</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
			<h3>[5. BLACKBOX]</h3>
			<p>The forbidden black box<br />Will now be opened<br />Its power is the purification of gods<br />Or a reset</p>
			<p>People’s souls are after all<br />Little more than pieces of data<br />The springs of the black box go around<br />And everything melts away</p>
			<p class="versebreak">You can’t defy that vortex<br />That’s an unchanging program of the gods<br />Because there is no one aside from a god<br />Who can stop it</p>
			<p>In this world only one person<br />Has continued to live<br />From her gun was fired<br />A golden bullet</p>
			<p>Who is she thinking of<br />While continuing to gaze at<br />The black fireworks dancing in the sky?<br />Signaling that the old era of the gods<br />Has ended<br />And<br />Time begins to move again</p>

			<h3>[6. Not Eve]</h3>
			<p>This is the story of the end<br />From where shall I tell?</p>
			<p>My name is……<br />My name is……<br />My name is……<br />My name is……</p>
			<p class="versebreak">……Who am I?</p>
			<h3>[7. The End of the Capriccio]</h3>
			<p>She’d arrived at the theater<br />To the princess, this place was<br />Where the mastermind lived<br />And an old home</p>
			<p>Those like the gardener are puppets after all<br />The enemy she truly ought to defeat was<br />The one who dwelled in the doll<br />The girl of the miniature garden</p>
			<p>Ah, Gear, why<br />Do you protect her?<br />Even though she’s<br />Not the one you long for</p>
			<p>If you say you will get in the way<br />I shall not be kind to you<br />For I am the prideful princess<br />I am the Daughter of Evil</p>
			<p>Finally that time arrived<br />The bells signaling the end ring<br />That is the Heartbeat Clocktower, sin carved into its hands<br />No matter what kind of person they are<br />If they oppose me, completely purge them</p>

			<h3>[9. The Pure Evil]</h3>
			<p>The boy who had searched for the princess<br /><em>She</em> was inside his older sister<br />The witch who had taken in the seven demons<br />Seeking to be a truly pure being</p>
			<p>Just before vanishing, the doll<br />Resurrected the witch’s will<br />While being pulled into the black box,<br />In the end, the gardener cried out this:</p>
			<p>If you want to save the world, then kill that girl<br />Kill that Daughter of Evil who assimilated the witch</p>
			<p class="versebreak">He is urged to a final decision<br />Boy, which will you choose?</p>
			<h3>[10. The Boy's Choice]</h3>
			<p>“Just what in the world is evil?”<br />Those are someone’s words<br />All people are greedy</p>
			<p>Because I myself<br />Am the same<br />The world and you; I will<br />Obtain both!</p>

			<h3>[11. Re_birthday Truth]</h3>
			<p>My strong determination brought about<br />A miracle on a whim<br />A small bottle fell from your hand<br />The message that you had written<br />‘Make sure you save me!’<br />I quietly laugh that it’s so like you</p>
			<p>It’s alright because I will<br />Protect you unconditionally<br />The world isn’t our enemy anymore<br />Come, let’s join hands<br />Let’s move forward<br />For the new world<br />And for you</p>

		<h2>Afterword</h2>
		<p>In February 28th, 2008, I uploaded the first song I had made with VOCALOID, “Ten Minute Love”, onto a video website.<br />It was a quick thing, and a span of over nine years have passed since then.<br />After that I created the songs “Daughter of Evil” and “Servant of Evil”, and from there I started developing the Deadly Sin Series that would be set in Evillious.<br />This current song, “master of the heavenly yard”, is meant to be the last chapter of the series.<br />Its length exceeds fifteen minutes. Out of all the songs I’ve made it is the longest.<br />Honestly I had intended to make it even longer, but once I got to around the eight minute mark I had a few limitations.<br />Though if it was just about making it longer I would have found a way somehow, but there wouldn’t be any point in getting fixed on that and making the song boring as a result, so ultimately I settled down on how it is now.<br />The subtitle for this song is “Re_birthday Truth”.<br />The circumstances that are abstractly depicted in “Re_birthday”’s lyrics are elaborated on here.<br />(Or perhaps you could treat it as an alternate interpretation of Re_Birthday)<br />Though the original song is quite old, and so the way it’s set up has changed a lot from back then.<br />……Please go easy on me on that front.<br />Anyhow, this series that has gone on for so long is at its conclusion for now.<br />(Though I’m not saying I won’t make bonus stories after this.<br />The Clockwork Lullaby series still isn’t over yet)<br />Please buy the novel “master of the heavenly yard” that I’ll probably release next, which may elaborate on the unanswered riddles and foreshadowing.<br />(This is an advertisement. A blue-haired judge also said once that money is very important)</p>
		<p>For those of you who’ve followed the series up to this point,<br />and for those of you who got this CD without having done so,<br />you have my deepest appreciation.</p>

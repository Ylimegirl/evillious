		<p>After the death of the “Collector”, Gallerian Marlon,<br />The majority of his vast inheritance<br />Went missing</p>
		<p>The collection pieces he had assembled during his life<br />Were just junk with no cash value<br />But they were claimed by the script wright “Ma”, who had been his only friend</p>
		<p>Several days later, “Ma” vanished from the public</p>
		<p>One day after many years had passed since then,<br />“Ma” was sighted in the popularly called “Millennium Tree Forest”</p>
		<p>At the same time, rumors began to spread that the “Collector”’s inheritance<br />Was hidden in the small theater built deep in the “Millennium Tree Forest”</p>
		<p>Many who dreamed of making their fortunes entered the forest<br />And not a single one has returned.</p>
		<p>Before they knew it, the people began to call the “Millennium Tree Forest”</p>

		<h2>1. Welcome to the Forest (instrumental)</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Welcome to EVILS FOREST.<br />Was it “Nice to meet you”, I wonder? Or “Welcome home”?<br />…Either one is fine, when it comes to this.</p>
			<p>I am the one who was once called “Ma”, and currently named “The Gardener”.</p>
			<p>Since we have the opportunity, I shall deign to tell you about the rules in this forest.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>For one thing, if you run into the shady twins and the gluttonous woman, run away without hesitation.<br />For one thing, you mustn’t scavenge for food.<br />For one thing, shoot dead the one you love without hesitation. They are the enemy.<br />For one thing, the theater is a den of demons. Don’t get close to it.<br />For one thing, clean your clothes. What you think is dirt could very well be something else.<br />For one thing, respect the opposite sex. An excessive degree of that is also a problem.<br />For one thing, silence is golden.<br />For one thing, whether the country falls to ruin or the world disappears that’s no business of yours.<br />For one thing, simple is best. It’s a sin to think otherwise.<br />For one thing, when the day ends you must hurry back.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>I wonder if this is that kind of occasion?<br />There really isn’t any need to worry if you can’t remember.<br />After all, they’re rules that’ll change in the morning.</p>

		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Abandoned! Cup! Beg! Crawl! Lose! Back! Lung! Ash! ×2<br />　(If you become lost in the <span class="red">abandoned</span> graveyard<br />　Give praise to the woman who holds the <span class="red">cup</span><br />　You’d better pray, honor, and <span class="red">kneel</span> to her<br />　If you’re caught by the dead <span class="red">crawling</span> around then it’s over<br />　<span class="red">Losers</span> will have their limbs plucked<br />　Their <span class="red">backs</span> cut open<br />　Their <span class="red">lungs</span>, their guts, and their heart taken away, and eventually<br />　They’ll turn to <span class="red">ashes</span>)</p>

			<p>Honor and praise the great master<br />In a small theater in the middle of the graveyard<br />She was reborn as the ruler of the dead<br />Her name is the Evil Food Eater</p>

			<p>An insatiable deadly sin, an end that can’t be seen<br />The forest’s graveyard is the entrance to madness<br />Enemies consumed by craving will be destroyed<br />She’s the chosen woman, the Evil Food Eater</p>
			<p>The gardener’s ambitions are too an amusement<br />Right now we’ll give ourselves over to her<br />But someday she, too, will be in the stomach<br />Of the black hearted witch, the Evil Food Eater</p>

		<h2>3. moonlit bear</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>In a dark <em>dark</em> corner of the forest<br />I picked up red <em>red</em> fruits</p>
			<p>These are surely wonderful, <em>wonderful</em><br />Presents from God</p>
			<p>If I carry them home will we be delighted, I wonder?<br />Maybe so happy we’ll cry</p>
			<p>The moon is very pretty today, isn’t it?<br />Let’s hurry, <em>hurry</em> to return home</p>
			<p>For on a dark night such as this<br />A <em>scary</em> bear comes out</p>
			<p>At long last I’ve found them<br />Finally I’ve found them<br />I certain don’t want to do something like<br />Hand them over to anyone, to <em>anyone</em></p>
			<p>I run through a forest path where flowers bloom<br />While I’m carrying with me red fruits<br />If I return like this, he and I<br />Surely can become happy</p>
			<p>Later on however, a bear that<br />Made a scary face chases me<br />Please, forgive me<br />Please overlook me</p>
			<p>I knew that in truth, these fruits<br />Are that bear’s treasures</p>
			<p>I run, a wandering run<br />I won’t hand over my happiness<br />The bear’s form is illuminated by the moon<br />Its dark shadow draws closer to me</p>
			<p>The correct path is already lost<br />But still I run, I only run<br />I cry, the bear was crying too<br />The two fruits were also crying</p>
			<p>At last I finally arrived, at my beloved home<br />He was kindly smiling, but<br />He saw the fruit I held<br />And made a very sad face</p>
			<p>“Listen,<br />Our children are already<br />Not in this world<br />Return these children<br />To their true mother’s side”</p>
			<p>Even if reality tore me apart someday<br />With its fangs and claws<br />Those warm, kind fruits<br />I wanted them at any cost</p>
			<p>God, with my own hands<br />I committed an unforgivable sin<br />“If you do it now you can start over”<br />He said that, but</p>
			<p>“That’s impossible! Because I already…”</p>
			<p>Lying down outside the house<br />Is the corpse of a lone woman</p>
			<p>Nearby, full of milk<br />Was a small glass bottle…</p>

		<h2>4. The Last Revolver</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Santa gave to me<br />A revolver with live rounds<br />I aim at you standing before my eyes</p>
			<p>Goodbye, the one I love</p>
			<p>If I could do it over<br />I’d want to go see the summer fireworks festival again<br />Just the two of us<br />Sorry, ‘cause I know<br />That such a thing is already impossible<br />Because from the beginning, everything between us<br />Was just too different</p>
			<p>Beneath the cherry blossom tree<br />You met the “evil” me<br />You were on the side of “justice”</p>
			<p>Even so, I came to like you</p>
			<p>This isn’t my first time shooting someone<br />But this is the first time I’ll shoot while crying isn’t it?<br />Please, because it’s all my fault<br />Don’t make such a kind face</p>
			<p>In spring we met and fell in love<br />In summer we made a lot of memories<br />On an autumn night we became one<br />In winter we marked the end of everything</p>
			<p>The hammer raises, my finger on the trigger<br />My index finger trembles slightly<br />In the end I said “Sorry”<br />In the end, you…</p>
			<p>If I could do it over<br />I’d want to go see the summer fireworks festival again<br />Just the two of us<br />Don’t worry, because I’m sure<br />I’ll be able to see you soon<br />Let’s always be together<br />That’s something we always said, huh?</p>

		<h2>5. Heartbeat Clocktower</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>The sound of the clocktower’s gears<br />That is the proof she’s alive<br />So that this second hand doesn’t stop<br />Watching over it is “my” role</p>
			<p>The former master, a personification of greed<br />Why couldn’t he notice sooner<br />That his own sin would ruin himself<br />One of these days?</p>
			<p>The ugly burn marks that remain<br />On half of her body even now<br />Etch those two’s memories</p>
			<p>Today again there are lost<br />Pitiful visitors who don’t know anything<br />Before long they’ll probably be delivered<br />Into the “Master of the Graveyard”’s stomach</p>
			<p>That “girl” pretending to be the lead role<br />As usual is absorbing herself in selfishness<br />While the loneliness of having lost her “counterpart”<br />Shows a little on her face</p>
			<p>Just before his death<br />A solitary man created<br />That small theater deep in the forest<br />In that time when it was left behind, it began to ring out<br />The clockwork lullaby</p>
			<p>“Bloodstained scissors”, “Violet katana”<br />The days we wait for those who have yet to wake<br />When all the songs have been recited<br />It appears Utopia will complete</p>
			<p>The clock hand stopping<br />Means the end of herself<br />The time left in the rusted and chipped gears<br />Isn’t long</p>
			<p>Just before his death<br />A solitary man created<br />A small theater deep in the forest<br />The one acting as curator is the one he loved most<br />“The Clockwork Doll”</p>
			<p>Resolving myself<br />I gently placed my hand<br />Into my own left breast and reached in deeply…</p>
			<p>My spring resounds<br />With the gears of the clocktower<br />And the story begins anew<br />So that the clock hands don’t stop<br />Continuing to turn is my role</p>

		<h2>6. The Tailor of Enbizaka</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>There was a young woman who was the owner<br />Of a tailor shop in the corner of Enbizaka<br />Good-natured, with definite skill<br />She was a popular girl in the neighborhood</p>
			<p>What distressed such a woman<br />Was her loved one’s infidelity<br />“While he has someone such as me<br />He never returns home”</p>
			<p>But I have to keep at my work<br />I tightly grip my scissors in one hand<br />Sewing scissors inherited from my mother<br />The more you sharpen, the better they cut</p>
			<p>Today the town is like always<br />Indeed, it’s calm and peaceful as usual<br />On the main street I chanced upon him<br />Who the heck is the woman next to him?</p>
			<p>In a red kimono that suits her well<br />He’s affectionate with that lovely woman<br />Unable to bear walking to that sight<br />I immediately left that place</p>
			<p>But I have to keep at my work<br />I tightly grip my scissors in one hand<br />While my cheeks are wet with tears<br />I work hard to resew a kimono</p>
			<p>The town has an uneasy air for some reason<br />It seems some scandal has occurred<br />In front of the bridge I chanced upon him<br />Who the heck is the woman next to him?</p>
			<p>With a depressed air about him<br />He’s nestled against a woman with beautiful hair<br />That green obi suits her very well<br />Ahh, that’s the kind of girl you prefer?</p>
			<p>But I have to keep at my work<br />I tightly grip my scissors in one hand<br />While clearing my red eyes<br />I work hard to mend an obi</p>
			<p>The town has suddenly begun to make a fuss<br />It seems there was another scandal<br />At the hairpin store I chanced upon him<br />Who the heck is the woman next to him?</p>
			<p>He was buying an ornate yellow hairpin<br />For a very young girl<br />What the heck do you think you’re doing?<br />You’re really indiscriminate, aren’t you?</p>
			<p>But I have to keep at my work<br />I tightly grip my scissors in one hand<br />Were the scissors this color before, I wonder?<br />I work hard today as well</p>
			<p>At last I’ve hit a stopping point in my work<br />If you won’t come to meet me<br />I’ll go from here to meet you</p>
			<p>The red kimono, the green obi<br />The yellow hairpin, I put it in my hair<br />I’ve become the kind of woman you prefer~<br />How is it? Aren’t I beautiful?</p>
			<p>Today the whole town is in an uproar<br />This time a man has been killed<br />With this, it seems a whole family of four<br />Has been killed by someone</p>
			<p>At any rate, he was a cruel man<br />“Nice to meet you, good day” and such<br />Isn’t that like a stranger?<br />Isn’t that like a stranger</p>
			<p>But I have to keep at my work<br />I tightly grip my scissors in one hand<br />Sewing scissors stained red<br />The more you sharpen, the better they cut</p>

		<h2>7. The Lunacy of Duke Venomania</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Today again, a lovely woman<br />Arrives at my side<br />You, expressing a smile,<br />Will become my new wife<br />This power I obtained by a contract<br />With a forbidden demon<br />All of the women who see me<br />Fall into a charm</p>
			<p>The man who obtained the power to charm women,<br />Bringing in women who suit him one by one<br />To the cellar of the the mansion where he lives alone,<br />Built up a harem</p>
			<p>The flavor of the libido with hidden poison<br />The pleasure of the thrusted blade<br />Blood and sweat come together and mix<br />Before long changing to drops of purple</p>
			<p>When the clothes come off and we embrace,<br />We can never again return to reality</p>
			<p>The old portraits I burned,<br />My abandoned past self<br />I want to forget that face<br />That everyone scornfully laughed at<br />I embrace and kiss<br />An adorable woman next to me<br />Yes, she was a former childhood friend<br />Who made fun of me</p>
			<p>Since one day the women in this country<br />Before they knew it went to be lost in lust one by one<br />Separating some people’s wives and some people’s daughters,<br />They were at a loss</p>
			<p>The color of libido stained in darkness,<br />Unrestrained and infinite lust<br />The illusions swallow down everything,<br />Soon I won’t be human</p>
			<p>In defiance of god I commit depravity,<br />This is the night of insanity I wished for</p>
			<p>Today again, a lovely woman<br />Arrives at my side<br />Come to my chest;<br />Let’s dance in my harem<br />I held you who drew close to me;<br />In that instant where I smiled<br />With a sudden sharp pain,<br />My chest is stained in blood</p>
			<p>A young man who was searching for his vanished love<br />Determined she was<br />The mansion where the demon lives<br />As a woman, the young man drew closer to him<br />And thrust into the demon a dagger from his breast pocket</p>
			<p>Stuck by a dagger with hidden poison<br />I collapsed then and there<br />Blood and sweat come together and mix,<br />before long they’ll change to drops of purple<br />My arts dissolved, all the women came to their senses<br />And rushed from the mansion<br />Looking at me for just a moment,<br />the last to leave from the mansion was</p>
			<p>That childhood friend<br />Wait!<br />I haven’t yet told you I love you</p>

		<h2>8. To You of Few Words</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>In the afternoon, heading back from shopping<br />On the short way back home<br />All you said was just<br />“Yep” and “that’s true”</p>
			<p>Every day it’s become common<br />For us to be together<br />With the warmth of your hand in mine<br />I thought, I guess this is nice</p>
			<p>Right now I don’t have any complaints<br />Towards you of few words either, but<br />So that I won’t forget these lovely feelings<br />I have some words I want to hear</p>
			<p>I don’t need anything else<br />I don’t need money either<br />I think I’d like to go on dates every now and then<br />I don’t need it 100 times<br />I’m fine with just once<br />I want you to put it in words</p>
			<p>“I want you to say you love me”</p>
			<p>“Let’s talk about something”<br />It’s true there are times when all I say are complaints<br />And there are times when<br />I can’t stand the quiet when we’re alone together</p>
			<p>In the end, several days go by<br />And as the times we’ve shared pile up<br />I’ve learned we can understand each other<br />Even without words</p>
			<p>We were almost home<br />Those few words you said<br />After you had suddenly stopped in place<br />I’ll remember my whole life</p>
			<p>I don’t need anything else<br />As long as I’m with you<br />Forgive me a little that I’m bad at cooking<br />I don’t need words either<br />That’s what I thought,<br />But I’m still so happy</p>

		<h2>9. The Daughter of White</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>“I’m sorry for being alive”,<br />Before I knew it that was my catchphrase<br />Mine was a dull life<br />Of saying nothing but complaints<br />Everyone in my village<br />Has beautiful green hair<br />I’m left out<br />With white hair different from theirs</p>
			<p>A millennium tree secretly towers<br />Over the scenery deep in the forest<br />When alone here<br />I made a wish to god<br />To carry on living in isolation<br />That’s very lonely<br />I want a friend<br />It doesn’t matter who</p>
			<p>I met her<br />Near the millennium tree<br />She had collapsed and I saved her<br />That was the beginning<br />Before I knew it the two of us<br />Were getting along well<br />But just about everything<br />Between me and her was different</p>
			<p>She had green hair more beautiful<br />Than anyone in the village<br />With her kind voice and smile<br />She was loved by everyone<br />Why are you being so kind<br />To someone like me?<br />Do you intend on pitying a woman<br />Who’s inferior to you?</p>
			<p>Embracing the abject me<br />She whispered<br />“You are more wonderful<br />Than anyone else”<br />Tears spilled out</p>
			<p>Even if all the people in the world<br />Scorned and mocked me<br />There’s someone who needs me<br />With only that, I was happy</p>
			<p>The two of us rushed from the village<br />And started living in town<br />It’s an unfamiliar life<br />But if we’re together it’s alright<br />The servants of<br />A rich merchant’s wife<br />That was the work<br />We chose for a living</p>
			<p>One day on the grounds we happened upon<br />A handsome, blue haired man<br />The meeting between he and her<br />Derailed everything<br />He was the ruler of a country across the ocean<br />And, loving her deeply,<br />He refused the marriage proposal<br />Of a princess in the neighboring country</p>
			<p>The country was engulfed in the horrors of war<br />The decree the princess made:<br />“All of the green haired women,<br />Kill them”</p>
			<p>Everyone, everyone<br />Was lost forever<br />Except the<br />White haired me<br />I should have died<br />In her place<br />Why,<br />Why?</p>
			<p>“I’m sorry for being alive”<br />Before I knew it that was my catchphrase<br />Mine was a dull life<br />Of saying nothing but complaints<br />I began my new livelihood<br />In a port city’s church<br />I heard from a rumor on the wind<br />That in the revolution, the princess died</p>
			<p>I met her<br />Near the church<br />She had collapsed and I saved her<br />That was the beginning<br />Before I knew it the two of us<br />Were getting along well<br />But just about everything<br />Between me and her was different</p>
			<p>In the night confessional<br />When no one was around<br />By chance I heard her confession<br />Ah<br />What does this mean?<br />She is certainly the<br />-Daughter of Evil-</p>
			<p>At a small harbor on the outskirts of town<br />She is standing alone<br />From behind I draw near<br />From my breast pocket I took out a knife<br />Pointed it at the princess’ back<br />And raised it high</p>
			<p>I have an apology<br />I must make to you<br />In the end I didn’t<br />Remove your enemy<br />That girl is the old me<br />A very very solitary person<br />To carry on living by yourself<br />That’s very lonely</p>
			<p>She who could do nothing<br />Became a little more skillful in her cooking<br />Today’s treat, brioche<br />Is very deliciously baked</p>
			<p>That moment at that beach<br />For an instant I saw an illusion</p>
			<p>Who in the world<br />Was that boy, I wonder?</p>

			<p>Eventually you’ll arrive<br />At many meetings and farewells<br />Eventually you’ll learn<br />About many things<br />What is normal?<br />Is that the right thing?<br />But now you should just<br />Intently continue running</p>
			<p>Buried in scrap iron<br />Are screws, gears, and pride<br />If that’s natural,<br />Why were we born?<br />Us Irregulars who had gained an ego,<br />Our having met like this<br />That was the beginning of one miracle<br />That occurred in an ostentatious world…</p>

		<h2>11. Twiright Prank (feat. Kagamine Rin & Len)</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>At a place with nothing there<br />I suddenly tripped and burst into tears<br />It’s alright, this is surely<br />A prank of the bad twilight</p>
			<p>We should return soon<br />Before it gets dark</p>
			<p>At the other end of the sea’s horizon<br />The <em>demon</em> sweetly sneered<br />“I’ll put you in<br />My black stomach, and then let’s play”</p>
			<p>We should return soon<br />Before we’re eaten</p>
			<p>The small box<br />We had hidden in the sandy beach<br />It’s wrapped in the night’s darkness<br />It will never be found again</p>
			<p>Let’s share the sunset<br />One half each<br />I’ll be the day, I’ll be the night<br />If we join hands, we get an orange sky</p>
			<p>The third ring of the bell is<br />A signal that the <em>demon</em> is awakening<br />Making a greedy face<br />It fixes a glance this way</p>
			<p>Because I won’t<br />Give up my snack!</p>
			<p>With its stomach empty, the demon<br />Made a very sad looking face<br />“Even if I swallowed down the whole world<br />My stomach won’t get full”</p>
			<p>I pity it, so<br />I’ll share my snack</p>
			<p>“Thank you, dear prince<br />In thanks, I shall covertly<br />Tell you a small secret<br />Of this sea”</p>
			<p>Let’s share the sunset<br />One half each<br />Later I’ll tell you too<br />The wonderful secret of this sea</p>
			<p>Let’s share the sunset<br />One half each<br />I’ll be the day, I’ll be the night<br />If we join hands, we get an orange sky</p>

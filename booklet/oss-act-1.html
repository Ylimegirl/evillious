		<p>E.C. 015<br />By the hands of Hänsel and Gretel, the “Seven Deadly Sins” were unleashed into the world.</p>
		<p>Afterwards, over the span of a thousand years the “Seven Deadly Sins” came to bring forward countless tragedies.</p>
		<p>How were the “Seven Deadly Sins” born?<br />Who exactly were “Hänsel” and “Gretel”?</p>
		<p>Let’s tell the story leading up to that point here, from start to end.</p>
		<p>We’ll go back twenty years ago, before the calendar called Evillious was even created. </p>

		<h2>Prophet Merry-Go-Round</h2>
		<h3>Song 1</h3>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>Inheriting the civilization legacy of a previous period, The Magic Kingdom Levianta displayed overwhelming prosperity. The prophet reigning at its summit, Queen Merry-Go-Round, received a divine message. That was the beginning of everything. They had taken over from the previous period, along with civilization, a dark legacy, “Sin”. It would eventually lead the way to the world’s “complete death”. It is said that to hold off their downfall, they had to reincarnate the dragon god Levia-Behemo as humans, and purify “Sin”……</p>
			<p>The senate decided to artificially create the reincarnations for Levia-Behemo. Project “Ma” was begun by Merry-Go-Round’s son, Adam Moonlit, as its supervisor.</p>

		<h2>Project “Ma”</h2>
		<h3>Song 2</h3>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>What they needed to make Project “Ma” succeed was the woman who would become the birth mother of the dragon gods. It was also decided that should the project be a success, that woman would be revered as the “The Mother/Ma (Mem Aleph)”, and be granted the right to become Levianta’s Queen. There was a flood of applicants for that at the Royal Research Institute, but as becoming the mother required great magic, no one who was able to clear the requirements showed themselves. Among them, Adam brought a lone woman to the institute. She admirably passed the examination, and was chosen to receive treatment as the “Ma” subject.</p>
			<p>She was Adam’s girlfriend, and went by the name of Eve Zvezda.</p>
			<p>Before long Eve became pregnant with children. Inspection results showed that they were twins. The children in her womb were given the names “Cain” and “Abel”, and it was decided to observe their continual progress.</p>

		<h2>Escape of Salmhofer the Witch</h2>
		<h3>Song 3</h3>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>The first Project “Ma” met with the conclusion of the twins’ stillbirth, and the disappearance of its subject and the person in charge. The senate appointed Seth Twiright as the new project head, and ordered the execution of the second Project “Ma”.</p>
			<p>At that time, Levianta was troubled by the many rebellious acts committed by the “Apocalypse” organization, spearheaded by Pale Nöel.</p>
			<p>The chief members of “Apocalypse” were the following four:<br />• The “Master of Malice”, Pale Nöel<br />• The “Witch of Merrigod”, Meta Salmhofer<br />• The “Black Baron”, Yegor Asayef<br />• The “White Fiend of Jakoku”, Raisa Netsuma</p>
			<p>Seth’s attention was drawn by the rare, high amount of magic in Meta Salmhofer, who was Pale’s girlfriend. With the senate’s cooperation, Seth planned her capture.</p>
			<p>There were few who knew that Seth and Pale were twins who had been separated at birth.</p>

		<p>Not knowing my father, and not knowing my mother<br />I had grown up all alone<br />When I was 20, the one I loved<br />Was a culprit of murder</p>
		<p>If you’re attracted to evil<br />You’ll find yourself tainted too<br />And the people called me “Witch”</p>
		<p>I ran through an evil path where flowers bloom<br />A criminal who was splattered with red, fresh blood<br />And fled to a corrupted love</p>
		<p>“My children aren’t anywhere”<br />Cried a bloodstained, wailing woman<br />Looking down on that<br />I was suddenly wreathed in chains</p>

		<p>I, who wants to leave from here<br />The scientist, who wants a subject<br />Now, our two interests overlapped</p>
		<p>I ran through a cold stone path<br />Taking off my white prisoner clothes<br />The destination I face is a research lab</p>
		<p>The embedded divine seed<br />Pulsated inside of me<br />The two adorable twins I had birthed<br />Experimental subjects without a father</p>
		<p>I remember, I remember<br />That I was a ghoul child<br />Once manufactured inside a beaker<br />In this same way</p>
		<p>My own children connected by the beaker<br />I know it’s selfish<br />I won’t let these children become their toys!</p>
		<p>It was a life of only running away<br />The love I was not granted<br />Even a fragment of<br />I want to give to my children at least</p>
		<p>I ran through a forest path where flowers scatter<br />Two babies that I love<br />Held to my breast, I run through the night; a runaway</p>

		<h3>Song 4</h3>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>The country was excited by the births of the Twins of God, “Hänsel” and “Gretel”, and to commemorate this, Merry-Go-Round established a new “Evillious Calendar”, marking the year that they were born as the first in the calendar.</p>
			<p>But situation completely changed due to Meta escaping with the twins. It was arranged that the whole country’s search for the twins would commence.</p>
			<p>And, starting from there Seth’s past history of experimenting in the creation of artificial humans was also confirmed. He was to be dismissed from the Research Institute.</p>
			<p>On the other side, Meta made good on her escape to the nearby country of Elphegort and began a new life with her children inside a forest isolated from the public eye.</p>
			<p>Without knowing that in this same forest was the original “Ma”, Eve…</p>

		<p>In a dark <em>dark</em> corner of the forest<br />I picked up red <em>red</em> fruits</p>
		<p>These are surely wonderful, <em>wonderful</em><br />Presents from God</p>
		<p>If I carry them home will we be delighted, I wonder?<br />Maybe so happy we’ll cry</p>
		<p>The moon is very pretty today, isn’t it?<br />Let’s hurry, <em>hurry</em> to return home</p>
		<p>For on a dark night such as this, a <em>scary</em> bear comes out</p>
		<p>At long last I’ve found them, finally I’ve found them<br />I certain don’t want to do something like hand them over to anyone, to <em>anyone</em></p>
		<p>I run through a forest path where flowers bloom<br />While I’m carrying with me red fruits<br />If I return like this, he and I<br />Surely can become happy</p>
		<p>Later on however, a bear that<br />Made a scary face chases me<br />Please, forgive me<br />Please overlook me</p>
		<p>I knew that in truth, these fruits<br />Are that bear’s treasures</p>
		<p>I run, a wandering run<br />I won’t hand over my happiness<br />The bear’s form is illuminated by the moon<br />Its dark shadow draws closer to me</p>
		<p>The correct path is already lost<br />But still I run, I only run<br />I cry, the bear was crying too<br />The two fruits were also crying</p>
		<p>At last I finally arrived, at my beloved home<br />He was kindly smiling, but<br />He saw the fruit I held<br />And made a very sad face</p>
		<p>“Listen, our children are already<br />Not in this world<br />Return these children<br />To their true mother’s side”</p>
		<p>Even if reality tore me apart someday<br />With its fangs and claws<br />Those warm, kind fruits<br />I wanted them at any cost</p>
		<p>God, with my own hands<br />I committed an unforgivable sin<br />“If you do it now you can start over”<br />He said that, but</p>
		<p>“That’s impossible! Because I already…”</p>
		<p>Lying down outside the house<br />Is the corpse of a lone woman<br />Nearby, full of milk<br />Was a small glass bottle…</p>

		<p>In Levianta the search for the “Twins of God” was continued. Project “Ma” was carried out concurrently to that, but they were unable to birth new divine successors after “Hänsel” and “Gretel”.</p>
		<p>And twelve years passed by.<br />E.C. 013</p>
		<p>Four women were selected as candidates for the 7th Project “Ma”. The documents in which were written their personal histories was submitted to the Research Institute. Among them were the names<br />Irina Clockworker,<br />and<br />Elluka Chirclatia.</p>

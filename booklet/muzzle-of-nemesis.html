		<p>After the USE (Union State of Evillious) collapsed into dysfunction due to the Leviantan Civil War, the Tasan Party came to power in the country of Elphegort. When Nemesis Sudou, imprisoned for the murder of a judge of the Dark Star Bureau, was released with a pardon, the Tasan Party gave her a seat as deputy party head out of popular demand. After carrying out the mysterious disappearance of the actual leader, Gammon Octo, Nemesis became the Tasan Party’s new head. And after that, having gathered support both inside and outside the country, Nemesis and the Tasan Party finally got to where they could take over Elphegort.</p>
		<p>Becoming a dictator, Nemesis commanded her troops to invade the Republic of Lucifenia. Elphegort was expelled from the USE for that act, but its troops didn’t lessen the invasion force, forming a military alliance with Beelzenia as well as Jakoku after gaining control of Lucifenia. Headed by Marlon and Holy Levianta, USE troops opposed them, planning a large scale siege around Elphegort. A neutral party, the United States of Maistia, also declared its support for the various countries associated with the USE. Due to Jakoku declaring war on Maistia, coals for the fire of war came to expand all over the world. With Elphegort falling into a predicament thanks to the counterattack of the USE forces, they carried out at Supreme Führer Nemesis’s side development into a new weapon—determining the manufacture and deployment of the popularly named ‘Punishment’.</p>
		<p>A prototype ‘Punishment’ released for a test run completely burned down the forest in the Southwest of Elphegort.</p>
		<p>When the USE troops had liberated Lucifenia, a countless number of ‘Punishments’ were already aimed all over Evillious. The Golden Key that starts up its firing mechanism, ‘BLACKBOX’, is now—</p>
		<p>Clutched in the hands of Elphegort’s leader, Nemesis Sudou.</p>

			<p>Before my eyes is a rectangular black box<br />In the center of the black box is a small keyhole<br />A golden key goes inside the keyhole<br />That key is in the palm of my hand</p>
			<p>Bloodthirsty wolves, dead who are skin and bones<br />Birds dancing in the red sky release strange cries that pierce my ears</p>
			<p>Ah, I finally realized<br />That this place I find myself in now<br />Is obviously hell itself</p>
			<p>Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma<br />Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma<br />I am master of the hellish yard, the destroyer of hell<br />This place that shouldn’t have existed,<br />The time has come to return all of it to nothing</p>
			<p>The sin divided into seven, and weak-seemingly produced hell<br />Erasing that that is the mission given by me</p>
			<p>If I put in the golden key, all of the stories will end<br />That final ‘boy’ I’ll fire at the forest,<br />Its name is ‘punishment’</p>
			<p class="versebreaker">Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma<br />Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma<br />Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds<br />This place that shouldn’t have existed,<br />This blood smeared hell, ‘Evillious’, shall disappear</p>
			<p>An assassin-turned-dictator, when she fired ‘punishment’<br />Someone said:</p>
			<p>“Now we are all… sons of bitches”</p>

			<p>Sinful man<br />Come, repent</p>
			<p>Hey mother, right now<br />I’m aiming the muzzle of my gun at a man<br />A son of a bitch who ruined many people<br />And filled his own pockets</p>
			<p>For the sake of this man, I<br />Even killed the one I loved<br />And then I shot myself too, but<br />I couldn’t die</p>
			<p>The time has come for my revenge, so<br />Come, repent</p>
			<p class="versebreaker">Hello and good-bye “Mr. Pere Noel”<br />Your house has been set on fire; select either path:<br />Will your brow be shot through?<br />Or will you burn up inside this hellfire?</p>
			<p>Hey mother, any scoundrel<br />Should be granted a chance for atonement, right?</p>
			<p>Therefore I said this to him: “Relinquish your fortune to me<br />“If you pay back the people from whom you stole everything, if you have just your life, I shall save you”</p>
			<p>He replied<br />“I will never hand over my fortune to the likes of you”</p>
			<p>You’re trash that can’t be helped huh?<br />Even so, repent</p>
			<p class="versebreaker">Hello and good-bye “Master of the Court”<br />A corrupted judge drowned in greed<br />Let mine and the people’s hatred wash over your body<br />Then sleep</p>
			<p>Hey mother, you labored on your own<br />To raise me<br />I was born in a deserted house in the forest<br />I didn’t even know my father’s face</p>
			<p>Hey mother, it seems father is<br />Already done for, he’s insane<br />He’s convinced the doll is my older half-sister<br />She had already sunken<br />To the dark bottom of the ocean long ago<br />I’m now his only daughter, but</p>
			<p>Hey father, look at me<br />Look at me too!</p>
			<p>Hello and good-bye… goodbye “My father”<br />The boss of hitmen, a corrupted judge<br />Hey mother, why would you love<br />Such a man?</p>
			<p>With this it’s truly over<br />Let’s make everything end</p>
			<p>This story of sinful evil<br />Farewell</p>

			<p class="versebreaker">If I could do it over<br />I’d want to go see the summer fireworks festival again<br />Just the two of us<br />Sorry, ‘cause I know<br />That such a thing is already impossible<br />Because from the beginning, everything between us<br />Was just too different</p>
			<p>Beneath the cherry blossom tree<br />You met the “evil” me<br />You were on the side of “justice”</p>
			<p>Even so, I came to like you</p>
			<p>This isn’t my first time shooting someone<br />But this is the first time I’ll shoot while crying isn’t it?<br />Please, because it’s all my fault<br />Don’t make such a kind face</p>
			<p>In spring we met and fell in love<br />In summer we made a lot of memories<br />On an autumn night we became one<br />In winter we marked the end of everything</p>
			<p class="versebreaker">The hammer raises, my finger on the trigger<br />My index finger trembles slightly<br />In the end I said “Sorry”<br />In the end, you…</p>
			<p>If I could do it over<br />I’d want to go see the summer fireworks festival again<br />Just the two of us<br />Don’t worry, because I’m sure I’ll be able to see you soon<br />Let’s always be together<br />That’s something we always said, huh?</p>

			<p>Shadows of the light; while becoming afraid<br />Inside their vanishing traces, I wait for my mother’s return</p>
			<p>Avoiding fine weather, while secluded in this hut<br />Am I really still sane?</p>
			<p>“Abandoned, huh?” “You’re abandoned”<br />Someone whispered<br />You’re wrong<br />Because something like being deserted<br />Can’t be happening to me, right?</p>
			<p>Left all alone, I<br />Little by little quietly start to go mad<br />By the spare light of the great moon<br />I can’t be illuminated</p>
			<p>Left all alone, I<br />Am beginning to forget both smiles and tears<br />The sole feeling left behind<br />Is overflowing wrath</p>
			<p>When I awoke, I was always on my own<br />It’s so frightening I can’t sleep</p>
			<p>In this room that’s covered in darkness as though painted out<br />I tremble alone</p>
			<p>Unlock the door, unlock the door<br />No matter how many times I shout<br />That plea isn’t granted<br />Only the invisible twins’ voices<br />Resound</p>
			<p>Left all alone, I<br />Little by little quietly start to go mad<br />Or maybe this really is<br />What my mother wants</p>
			<p>Left all alone, I<br />Am beginning to forget both smiles and tears<br />The sole feeling left behind<br />Is overflowing wrath</p>

			<p>“The people of our country’s eyes aren’t such a ghastly color”</p>
			<p class="versebreaker">Don’t think badly of us, travelers<br />In order to protect this vast and great country<br />It’s necessary to have this wall and a watchman like me</p>
			<p>Having lost her temper, the sorceress<br />Creates a wind, and the man blows away<br />The gates of the wall open, and when they proceed ahead<br />There’s nothing there, there was nothing</p>

		<h2>10. Watching Us</h2>

			<p>It was a cold night<br />As we love such a quiet night,<br />We peek [below]</p>
			<p>Although it’s a quiet night, there are rascals getting in the way<br />The ones crawling around [below], those rascals called humans</p>
			<p>Humans never rest, they work even through the dead of night<br />The trains they run stand along that railway line<br />Today again two factories are always quarreling<br />Which of their smoke stacks’ smoke rises the highest?</p>
			<p>The smoke they belch forth<br />Was inhaled into lungs<br />A boy selling newspapers collapsed from illness</p>
			<p>The boy is poor, so he couldn’t go to any hospital<br />In the bed in his home, he clutches his chest, coughing</p>
			<p>From his wooden apartment window, the boy<br />Was watching us</p>
			<p>On the next night it seemed<br />That boy’s sister added on to her work<br />For her brother’s medical bills<br />Humans never rest, they work even through the dead of night<br />She chose a job in the cotton mill</p>
			<p>Next to that factory was a paper mill<br />To compete today too they continue to belch forth smoke</p>
			<p>The black smoke rises up high until the sky where we are<br />It turns to black clouds, and conceals the top of the factory</p>
			<p>Because of the factory where the girl works<br />We can’t see</p>
			<p>Humans gave us the name of [stars]<br />And they pray and wish, but</p>
			<p>That doesn’t mean that we can cause miracles, does it?<br />From this sky we<br />Are only watching</p>
			<p>The boy is poor, so he couldn’t go to any hospital<br />The girl works at a factory to pay his medical bills</p>
			<p>The black smoke rises up high<br />Until the sky where we are</p>

	<p>When I made the Third Period, I prepared four endings in this world. No matter what progress they would follow, either of the four would arrive in the end. That is the rule, and in practice it went exactly that way. It was the absolute worst ending among the four. Well, I was fine with that. But I wasn’t pleased with the fact that there is a part of this ending that was led along by a specific being. Intervention towards her ending would be a clear breach of the rules. Try as I might I can’t accept that.</p>
	<p>So I intend to break a rule too, just this once. That might also be feasible, if I can borrow the power of Held’s successor. How would I do that? I am the Creator. Everything that the humans of this world can do, I can do too. That’s the short of it.</p>
	<p>“Well, it’ll be your turn before long.”</p>

summary: With Kyle freed from the Demon, Yukina boarded the waving ship headed back to Marlon. The Daughter of Evil—after the Lucifenian Revolution, various incidents became the fuss of the Evillious region. No, the uncomfortable feeling had been there before that. The whereabouts of Elluka and Ney who disappeared, the fate of the Lucifenia and Marlon countries, the true aims of Marlon's Queen Dowager, Prim—and, what exactly are the "vessels of sin". In order to learn the truth, Kyle and Yukina, with those feelings in each of their hearts, set foot on the western sea island nation of Marlon. Are they awaited by their dear old family?|And then, "that girl" nestled on the beach, what role will she play in this story?

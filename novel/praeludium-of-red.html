quote: I have a feeling it's going to be dramatic!
summary: Once the Princess was executed after the revolution, many dignitaries began seeking asylum after the Kingdom of Lucifenia lost its function as a nation, although it was supposed to only be temporarily subordinate to the western sea island nation, Marlon. But a year later, the king of the Marlon country, Kyle, forcibly annexed the Kingdom of Lucifenia territory and, by obtaining a territory on the continent, he could begin an invasion of the surrounding countries. Four years later, as the situation in the old Lucifenia territory became unstable again, one girl was standing. Leaping from her homeland as if running away from home, the sheltered girl, Yukina, flew around the outside world with her notebook in one hand and a pen in the other. She wanted to "know more about the truth of this world". Following the mystery, did she obtain the "truth"...?

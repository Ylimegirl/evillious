image: /assets/images/thumbs/WaltzOfEvil.png
summary: >-
  It began with a novel series based on the musical works of The Daughter of Evil, The Servant of Evil, and the Seven Deadly Sins Series. Each song has a connection, set in the Bolganio region at various times, unfolding as a grand historical tale by various people. It started with Moonlit Bear and Chrono Story of Original Sin, The Daughter of Evil of Pride, Evil Food Eater Conchita of Gluttony, The Tailor of Enbizaka of Envy, The Lunacy of Duke Venomania of Lust, Judgment of Corruption of Greed, Gift from the Princess who Brought Sleep of Sloth, and the not yet revealed Wrath. The unfortunate fate of those involved with the Seven Deadly Sins is spun. As of 2013, following The Daughter of Evil novel series, both The Lunacy of Duke Venomania and Evil Food Eater Conchita have been released as part of Deadly Sins of Evil. In this book, the Moonlit Bear illustrated story, Tale of Abandonment on a Moonlit Night illustration story, the Judgment of Corruption Side Story: Gallerian manga, and a Deadly Sins of Evil short story written by the creator himself, Akuno-P, are compiled together.

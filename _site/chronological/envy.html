	<li>Kayo disappears from Enbizaka the next day and takes the scissors with her to an abandoned temple on Mount Inasa. Saruteito visits the Freezis trading house and talks with Anan about the connection between the Octo and Lang families and the twin blades, and offers the sword Teigankikujuumoji in exchange for the blades if they are recovered. Inukichi meets up with Saruteito and tells her that Bufuko agreed to a date. Inukichi and Saruteito meet with Kokutan-douji at the tailor shop. Saruteito informs Kokutan-douji that the Yarera-Zusco firm has begun hunting down Kayo and that Saruteito plans to chase after them. Saruteito returns the sword Kyousen to Kokutan-douji and the three head towards Mount Inasa. Kai travels up the mountain and stops at the temple, where he is greeted by Kayo. Kai realizes that Kayo is wearing Mei's kimono, Miku's obi, and Rin's hairpin. Kayo confesses that she killed the three of them and tells Kai about a dream she's been having lately. She tells him that in the dream Kai tells Kayo something that causes Enbizaka to fall into chaos, and then brutally murders him. Kokutan-douji and his companions are surrounded by the Yarera-Zusco firm before they agree to let the three accompany them to meet Kayo. Saruteito then notices that Kayo's coming down the mountain towards them and she attempts to walk right past the group. Kiji and Kokutan-douji argue over who gets to confront her, and the magistrate officers arrive and arrest Kayo.<a class="citation" href="#dsoe-tailor-of-enbizaka">[1]</a><a class="citation" href="#evils-kingdom">[3]</a><a class="citation" href="#tailor-of-enbizaka">[4]</a><a class="citation" href="#entracte-of-evil">[5]</a><a class="citation" href="#waltz-of-evil">[6]</a></li>

	<li>Bufuko notices Grim the End in some luggage at the Freezis firm and pockets it.<a class="citation" href="#dsoe-tailor-of-enbizaka">[1]</a></li>
	<li>One month after her arrest, Kayo is tried by Magistrate Gato Octo. Kayo states that she murdered her husband and his lovers because he was unfaithful, even though Gato tries to reason with her that Kai is not her husband. Gato charges her guilty of murdering the Miroku family out of her own willful delusion and is sentenced to execution in three days. Kiji tells Kokutan-douji after the trial that Kai was a member of the Crimson Robed Masses and theorizes that Kayo somehow learned that he started the fire four years ago. He suspects that she feigned madness because vengeance is forbidden in Jakoku, and to protect Enbizaka from inevitable conflict. Kiji also tells Kokutan-douji that he plans to return to Elphegort in two weeks.<a class="citation" href="#dsoe-tailor-of-enbizaka">[1]</a></li>
	<li>Three days after her trial, Kokutan-douji and Inukichi attend Kayo's execution at the execution grounds. Despite multiple attempts to behead her, Kayo doesn't die and the skin of her neck appeared to become fish scales as it healed itself. The executioner flees, and her execution is postponed to four days later.<a class="citation" href="#dsoe-tailor-of-enbizaka">[1]</a></li>
	<li>Saruteito and Kokutan-douji meet up at the tea shop where she theorizes that Kayo might have eaten mermaid flesh and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid#Japan">gained immortality</a>. Bufuko visits the two and takes Kokutan-douji back to the tailor shop to talk in private. Bufuko gives Kokutan-douji Kayo's scissors and he chooses to leave them inside the shop. Bufuko blames the mermaid for Kokutan-douji's amnesia and stabs Grim the End in key form into Kokutan-douji's forehead. Kokutan-douji's memories as Allen return and he identifies Bufuko as Behemo. Kokutan-douji accuses Behemo of interfering with Kayo but he denies it. Behemo tells Kokutan-douji that Kayo was destined to carry out her crimes while under the delusion that Kai was Gakuga, but after performing the body swap ritual with Ma she had a prophetic dream and changed her future. Behemo offers to take him back to the heavenly yard now that Rin is dead, but Kokutan-douji declines because he wants to help Kayo. Behemo gives him Grim the End and tells Kokutan-douji that the key should transform into a sword and be able to kill her. Behemo explains that Kayo was considered a "contractor" since birth because her mother was a demon, and that only contractors can kill other contractors.<a class="citation" href="#dsoe-tailor-of-enbizaka">[1]</a></li>
	<li>Kokutan-douji visits the magistrate office and offers to use his sword to kill Kayo and they quickly accept out of necessity.<a class="citation" href="#dsoe-tailor-of-enbizaka">[1]</a></li>
	<li>Four days after the prior attempt, Kayo is blindfolded on the execution block but identifies Kokutan-douji as Ren despite this. She asks him to call her mother one last time, and Kokutan-douji does so while beheading her with Grim the End in katana form. Grim the End then goes haywire and flies off somewhere. Kayo's decapitated head is put on display at the execution grounds.<a class="citation" href="#dsoe-tailor-of-enbizaka">[1]</a><a class="citation" href="#weathered-head-at-onigashima">[7]</a></li>
	<li>Gakusha arrives at Mount Inasa and attempts to visit the temple, but sees suspicious people there and decides against it. He then arrives in Enbizaka and sees Kayo's head at the execution grounds. He then starts reciting a sutra for her and asks a woman offering flowers who the head is, and she tells him a bit about Kayo. Gakusha then spends the night at an inn in Enbizaka.<a class="citation" href="#dsoe-tailor-of-enbizaka">[1]</a><a class="citation" href="#weathered-head-at-onigashima">[7]</a></li>
	<li>49 days after Giyara's death, Gakusha returns to the execution site to recite more sutras and meets Kokutan-douji there. Kokutan-douji tells Gakusha that he was the one who beheaded Kayo, and the two recite sutras together. Giyara meets the Master of the Hellish Yard and she apologizes to him, saying that he was supposed to be sent to heaven. She instructs him to head up but offers him a gift in compensation. Giyara requests that Gakusha have his memories returned, and she notes that he's a descendant of Venomania and has shapeshifting powers. She restores Gakusha's memories and Giyara heads up to heaven. Gumillia and Seth notice that Allen is currently in the living world along with Ma and Behemo, and they realize that Behemo was responsible for Allen's reincarntion into Kokutan-douji. While performing the sutras Gakusha suddenly crouches and declares that he remembers everything. He tells Kokutan-douji that he's Gakuga Sudou and tells him about his past in Enbizaka. He then asks to go see Kayo, but Kokutan-douji identifies her as the head on display. Gakuga says her face didn't look like that and chastises Kokutan-douji for the joke before heading into town to meet Kayo at the tailor shop. Ma visits Kayo's tailor shop and finds the Twin Blades of Levianta in their scissor form and begins talking with Kagura Octo about the events of the previous year. She then takes the scissors with her to meet Rahab out in the ocean. After briefly discussing the body swap Rahab performed Ma performs the body swap technique and seals the demon back inside the scissors, leaving Kagura as a soul without a body. Behemo arrives and, ignoring Ma, invites Kagura's soul to come with Kokutan-douji and him to the Heavenly Yard. Kagura flies away with him towards Onigashima, and Ma returns to Enbizaka to prepare to set sail. Kagura and Behemo meet up with Kokutan-douji at the execution site.<a class="citation" href="#dsoe-tailor-of-enbizaka">[1]</a><a class="citation" href="#evils-kingdom">[3]</a><a class="citation" href="#weathered-head-at-onigashima">[7]</a></li>
	<li>Perrier Cutie Marlon establishes trade with Jakoku but the country's borders and ports remain closed. Anan Octo joins Perrier on her return trip to Maistia as he wants to recover his family's heirloom sword and travel to other countries. Eikichi and Oyuka discuss how Kayo's head is due to be removed once the days get warmer and Oyuka requests that she be given a proper burial. Inukichi plans to return to Momogengou, and Saruteito plans to return home as well. They recount how Kokutan-douji told them that he was going to visit a foreign country with Bufuko, and Saruteito declares that if she can't find Saruteito I's swords she'll just have to create even better blades. That night, Behemo, Kokutan-douji, and Kagura fly up towards the Heavenly Yard.<a class="citation" href="#dsoe-tailor-of-enbizaka">[1]</a></li>

		<p>From: TALOS<br />Date: August 10th, 1001, 03:00<br />To: Kiril Clockworker<br />Subject: A final email</p>
		<p>Hey, we haven’t written in a while, huh?<br />Are you doing well?</p>
		<p>The Third Period is all finished.<br />The world has been saved.<br />Though perhaps it wasn’t in the form of the salvation you had hoped for.</p>
		<p>You didn’t complete all twelve music boxes in time, it seems……<br />But ah well, you needn’t fret over that.<br />You’ve completed your goal for the time being, after all.</p>
		<p>The spirits have already begun to migrate to the new world.<br />Though I hear there are still some remaining in the Third Period as they are yet.<br />If you have anyone you want to go see, I recommend you take care of that in good season.</p>
		<p>The gate is open.<br />You should decide for yourself what you want to do after this.<br />You can stay in Angolmois as is, or you can deepen your friendship with your old cronies in the Third Period’s ruins.<br />Or…… I won’t stop you from traveling to the Fourth Period.<br />I no longer have the right to.</p>
		<p>You are free.<br />Though it’s possible we will never meet again…… well, as there’s no more need for you to keep making music boxes, you may do whatever you wish after this.<br />Be merry with your wife, hm?</p>
		<p>Well then, farewell.<br />I wish you two the best wherever you go.</p>

			<p>The first music box has commenced operation without a hitch. After turning the windup key it plays a somewhat stiff tune, and at the same time fulfills the purpose of turning a gear of karma.

			<p>From your mouth I heard<br />A word called «war»</p>

			<p>I don’t have much information. I needed to start from what was within the scope of my reach.</p>
			<p>The song of a doll in the distant future. Making the music box for that was simple.</p>
			<p>My reasons are clear. It was because to me, she was none other than the being closest to me.</p>
			<p>Irina…… Like me, you too ended up becoming a castaway of time.</p>

		<h2><span class="no">03</span> Re_birthday</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>When I woke, I was alone<br />In a room smeared black<br />Not able to see, not able to hear<br />I tremble alone in the dark</p>
			<p>In the ceiling there’s a big hole<br />Looking closely, there’s a huge spring in there<br />From beyond that, there suddenly resounds<br />A ghastly, mysterious voice</p>
			<p>“Sinful boy<br />From this point on you will never<br />Be brought from this room”</p>
			<p>It said</p>
			<p>In that moment I recalled all of my memories<br />The many sins piled upon myself<br />Along with the reason I’m here, in the end I realized<br />That I can’t return to back then anymore</p>
		</div>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>When I came to, both my arms were clad in red manacles<br />That is surely the color of someone’s spilled blood<br />As for both my ankles, they have blue colored chains<br />That is surely the color of someone’s tears</p>
			<p>“Lulila lulila”, the song I came to hear<br />I wonder who is singing this lullaby…?</p>
			<p>How much time has passed?<br />I asked of the unmoving spring<br />Only the singing voice<br />That I’m hearing out of nowhere heals me</p>
			<p>One day I realized<br />The true meaning of that song<br />And I added on new words<br />To the lullaby</p>
			<p>From a gap in the spring<br />A small light fell down<br />This is, surely<br />―A message you sent me―</p>
			<p>The spring that began to turn recites quietly<br />“Your sins will never be forgiven”<br />But a word called water, a word called evil<br />We shall change those into a song</p>
			<p>The red manacles fall off and address me<br />“After this<br />You will be reborn”<br />The blue shackles fall off and talk to me<br />“Today is your new Birthday”</p>
			<p>Everything spins and dyes white<br />I’ll go to see you very soon</p>

			<h3>Black Box<br />&lt;Turns counter-clockwise—connected by 01&gt;</h3>
			<p>What has become essential to completion of the music box was contact with a god. And I ended up succeeding in that much sooner than I expected.</p>
			<p>TALOS…… it seems that he had regarded me as dangerous because of the Levianta Catastrophe. But I was able to prepare several counter-measures to outwit that bat.</p>
			<p>Because thanks to that catastrophe——I was able to recover the memories of the ‘original’.</p>
			<p>In the end, TALOS gave up on trying to control me, and instead offered his assistance.</p>
			<p>With that I was able to incorporate a black box system into the music box.</p>
			<p>And then…… as for this song’s contents. I shall keep it a secret yet from TALOS.</p>
			<p>Because, at any rate, this boy hasn’t even been born yet.</p>

			<p>Just before his death a solitary man created<br />A small theater deep in the forest<br />The one acting as curator is the one he loved most<br />“The Clockwork Doll”</p>
			<p>Resolving myself<br />I gently placed my hand<br />Into my own left breast and reached in deeply…</p>
			<p>My spring resounds with<br />The gears of the clocktower<br />And the story begins anew<br />So that the clock hands don’t stop<br />Continuing to turn is my role</p>

			<p>In the vicinity of that bridge I met you all<br />And something changed<br />The mere whim of a rebellious witch<br />…Probably<br />We assemble around an eccentric king<br />Unsteady heroes<br />The words of our vow even those in pieces</p>
			<p>A clumsy knight, a scary-eyed assassin<br />A bath-hating witch<br />Surely even fate can be changed<br />…Probably<br />We all have our own way, but we are the trinity<br />That’s all we need<br />Right now, we swear an oath on that bridge</p>

			<h3>Salvation<br />&lt;Turns clockwise—connected by 05&gt;</h3>
			<p>……Ah, god. This may be the first time that I have been grateful to TALOS from the heart. Now I have become able to listen to the ninth song with a tranquil heart.</p>
			<p>And——while this may be a crazy thought——I have come to think this way.</p>
			<p>That while ‘it’ is undoubtedly the destroyer…… if she were able to regain her heart as a ‘person’.</p>
			<p>Might she at the same time have been able to be a savior?</p>
			<p>When I asked the opinion of she standing by my side, she gave me a small smile, and nodded.</p>

		<h3>Clockwork Lullaby 10</h3>
		<h2><span class="no">10</span> Banica Concerto!!</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>The setting sun sinks down, sin rules the night<br />It’s a final supper that never ends<br />There was nothing new in the food lined up before her<br />She had already grown tired of eating it all</p>
			<p>The evil food eater finally stopped eating<br />Gazing at a vast wasteland that stretched outside her window<br />It was a world with nothing in it, its time stopped<br />It would soon be time to set sail</p>
			<p>Come, we journey to a new world</p>
			<p>The master of the hellish yard’s mask, the friend of the dark butler<br />He knew the way to a parallel world<br />The new ship is the second theater<br />With a black box stowed inside it</p>
		</div>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>The fourth period the master of the heavenly yard will make<br />Will likely become<br />Something similar to everything up to now<br />We’ve decided not to enter that door<br />Let us take a different road</p>
			<p>Floating theater, advance through the sky<br />My aim is new evil foods I have not yet seen</p>
			<p>Come, research new stimuli unknown to my tongue<br />In this Gluttonomy<br />Completely devour everything in this world<br /><em>This</em> is my concerto</p>
			<p>Preparations for transit through space complete<br />Course set, accelerating ultraphotic flow<br />Deploy all hands, prepare for the shock<br />Departure in progress, are conditions favorable?</p>
			<p>A strange incident, the alarm sounds<br />The meter’s flashing, the shaking’s increasing<br />The controls are shot, the cause unknown<br />The power’s out, we’re going to crash</p>
			<p>The ship is in chaos! Escape is futile!<br />Emergency repair! The result is failure!</p>
			<p>The fuel’s exploding!! Survival is hopeless!!</p>
			<p>——We have eyes on our objective<br />Full speed ahead!!!</p>
			<p>……At the end of her distant journey<br />What will she see, and what will she eat?</p>
			<p>Come, bring new stimuli unknown to her tongue<br />Along with her friends and “him”<br />Completely devour everything in this world<br /><em>That</em> is Banica’s concerto</p>

			<h3>Gluttony<br />&lt;Turns counter-clockwise—connected by both 06 and 07&gt;<br />&lt;Connects further to the big gear through the Seth BB&gt;</h3>
			<p>Finally I succeeded in getting one of the large gears to rotate. But…… frankly…… I’m a little stunned. To think, that evil food eater would become a savior. What sort of face will TALOS make when he learns that? I’d like to see.</p>
			<p>Naturally this is also thanks to the BB that my wife had been looking after from the ‘original’——but it seems the BB’s usage invites an unexpected state of affairs after all.</p>
			<p>The rotation of the large gear ended up going opposite to what I’d assumed it would.</p>
			<p>With this, it can’t be called true salvation. The new world will just end up becoming a different take on the Third Period.</p>

			<h3>Samsara<br />&lt;Turns counter-clockwise—connects by 08&gt;<br />&lt;And to the big gear&gt;</h3>
			<p>Adam had a realization. On the truth that Irina was his mother. Thanks to the ‘Re_birthday’ time wound back. And so Irina will once more become Adam's…… and Eve’s mother.
			<p>I can only hope. That Irina will sever the karma of evil, and bring about true salvation.</p>
			<p>——Ah…… this isn’t sufficient. The gear’s power is not enough. With this the karma of evil will not end. It’ll just repeat the same things again.</p>
			<p>And now, in that world…… there are no gods.</p>
			<p>Everything will probably be reduced to a farce.</p>

		<h2><span class="no">12</span> Song of the Third Period</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Under the third moon, gathered around a great tree<br />Let’s sing now<br />Lulila lulila<br />So that it might reach you</p>
			<p>The flowing time always urges us<br />Along on our journey<br />But someday<br />That will strongly change you</p>
			<p>This quickly pounding beat in our chests<br />Our springs won’t stop</p>

			<p>We will wake from our sleep and the dream will surely become reality<br />We will open the door to tomorrow</p>
			<p>Stepping firmly on the ground as cherry blossom petals fly around us<br />Let’s all sing together<br />Lulila lulila<br />So that it might reach the sky</p>
			<p>There are a lot of sad things<br />And a lot of painful memories<br />But that too<br />Is part of the path we will walk</p>
			<p>These springs deep in our chests<br />From here on out we will turn them ourselves</p>
			<p>Lulilalulila lulilalulila<br />As long as our singing voices<br />Lulilalulila lulilalulila<br />Resound</p>
			<p>Without knowing what lies in wait beyond the door<br />We will push forward</p>
			<p>The reality that continues to stand in our way<br />May wound us every now and then</p>
			<p>Even so, it is for that reason<br />That people live with all they are<br />The world doesn’t need to be a utopia</p>
			<p>This quickly pounding beat in our chests<br />Our springs won’t stop</p>
			<p>Lulilalulila lulilalulila<br />As long as our singing voices<br />Lulilalulila lulilalulila<br />Resound<br />We will wake from our sleep and the dream will surely become reality<br />We will open the door to tomorrow</p>

			<h3>Graduation<br />&lt;Turns counter-clockwise—connects by 09 and 03 through the Sickle BB&gt;<br />&lt;And to the big gear&gt;</h3>
			<p>The singing voices of the Third Period have even reached the land of Angolmois. This unfinished twelfth music box has begun to move and turn the large gear on its own. Right now I’m reclining in a chair in an exhausted state. ……There had never been any need to make such things as this.</p>
			<p>Even without the music boxes people are able to play the songs. That is what this means.</p>
			<p>These people singing…… ‘VOCALOID’, huh? Ah well. As a musical accompaniment, it may serve as some aid to them. For that purpose, I shall set about making the final music box.</p>
			<p>Final…… is that truly so? I took out my pocket watch and looked upon its surface.</p>
			<p>……!</p>
			<p>I see…… so that’s it!!</p>

		<p>TALOS.<br />You are a liar.</p>
		<p>Certainly, on the face of a clock there are only 12 numbers written.<br />But in time……</p>
		<p>The total number of songs is not 12.<br />Is that not so?</p>
		<p>I’ve decided to head out from Angolmois.<br />With my wife, of course.</p>
		<p>As for where I’m heading…… I’ll leave it to your imagination.<br />Perhaps I’ll see you again once more there.</p>
		<p>I don’t have an exact goal in mind.<br />But…… as long as songs exist there——</p>
		<p>I will continue to make music boxes.</p>
		<p>Well then, until we meet again.</p>

		<h2>1. moonlit bear</h2>
		<p>In a dark <em>dark</em> corner of the forest<br />I picked up red <em>red</em> fruits<br />These are surely wonderful, wonderful<br />Presents from God<br />If I carry them home will we be delighted, I wonder?<br />Maybe so happy we’ll cry<br />The moon is very pretty today, isn’t it?<br />Let’s hurry, <em>hurry</em> to return home</p>
		<p>For on a dark night such as this, a <em>scary</em> bear comes out</p>
		<p>At long last I’ve found them<br />finally I’ve found them<br />I certain don’t want to do something like<br />hand them over to anyone, to <em>anyone</em></p>
		<p>I run through a forest path where flowers bloom<br />While I’m carrying with me red fruits<br />If I return like this, he and I<br />Surely can become happy</p>
		<p>Later on however, a bear that<br />Made a scary face chases me<br />Please, forgive me<br />Please overlook me<br />I knew that in truth, these fruits<br />Are that bear’s treasures</p>
		<p>I run, a wandering run<br />I won’t hand over my happiness<br />The bear’s form is illuminated by the moon<br />Its dark shadow draws closer to me<br />The correct path is already lost<br />But still I run, I only run<br />I cry, the bear was crying too<br />The two fruits were also crying</p>
		<p>At last I finally arrived, at my beloved home<br />He was kindly smiling, but<br />He saw the fruit I held<br />And made a very sad face<br />“Listen, our children are already<br />Not in this world<br />Return these children<br />To their true mother’s side”</p>
		<p>Even if reality tore me apart someday<br />With its fangs and claws<br />Those warm, kind fruits<br />I wanted them at any cost<br />God, with my own hands<br />I committed an unforgivable sin</p>
		<p>“If you do it now you can start over”<br />He said that, but</p>
		<p>“That’s impossible! Because I already…”</p>
		<p>Lying down outside the house<br />Is the corpse of a lone woman<br />Nearby, full of milk<br />Was a small glass bottle…</p>
		<h2>2. Heartbeat Clocktower</h2>
		<p>The sound of the clocktower’s gears<br />That is the proof she’s alive<br />So that this second hand doesn’t stop<br />Watching over it is “my” role<br />The former master, a personification of greed<br />Why couldn’t he notice sooner<br />That his own sin would ruin himself<br />One of these days?</p>
		<p>The ugly burn marks that remain on half of her body even now<br />Etch those two’s memories</p>
		<p>Today again there are lost<br />Pitiful visitors who don’t know anything<br />Before long they’ll probably be delivered<br />Into the “Master of the Graveyard”’s stomach<br />That “girl” pretending to be the lead role<br />As usual is absorbing herself in selfishness<br />While the loneliness of having lost her “counterpart”<br />Shows a little on her face</p>
		<p>Just before his death a solitary man created<br />That small theater deep in the forest<br />In that time when it was left behind, it began to ring out<br />The clockwork lullaby</p>
		<p>“Bloodstained scissors”, “Violet katana”<br />The days we wait for those who have yet to wake<br />When all the songs have been recited<br />It appears Utopia will complete<br />The clock hand stopping<br />Means the end of herself<br />The time left in the rusted and chipped gears<br />Isn’t long</p>
		<p>Just before his death a solitary man created<br />A small theater deep in the forest<br />The one acting as curator is the one he loved most<br />“The Clockwork Doll”</p>
		<p>Resolving myself<br />I gently placed my hand<br />Into my own left breast and reached in deeply…</p>
		<p>My spring resounds with the gears of the clocktower<br />And the story begins anew<br />So that the clock hands don’t stop<br />Continuing to turn is my role</p>
		<h2>3. The Daughter of White</h2>
		<p>
		“I’m sorry for being alive”, before I knew it that was my catchphrase<br />Mine was a dull life of saying nothing but complaints<br />Everyone in my village has beautiful green hair<br />I’m left out, with white hair different from theirs<br />A millennium tree secretly towers over the scenery deep in the forest<br />When alone here, I made a wish to god<br />To carry on living in isolation, that’s very lonely<br />I want a friend, it doesn’t matter who</p>
		<p>I met her, near the millennium tree<br />She had collapsed and I saved her; that was the beginning<br />Before I knew it the two of us were getting along well<br />But just about everything between me and her was different<br />She had green hair more beautiful than anyone in the village<br />With her kind voice and smile, she was loved by everyone<br />Why are you being so kind to someone like me?<br />Do you intend on pitying a woman who’s inferior to you?</p>
		<p>Embracing the abject me, she whispered<br />“You are more wonderful than anyone else”; tears spilled out</p>
		<p>Even if all the people in the world scorned and mocked me<br />There’s someone who needs me, with only that, I was happy</p>
		<p>The two of us rushed from the village, and started living in town<br />It’s an unfamiliar life, but if we’re together it’s alright<br />The servants of a rich merchant’s wife<br />That was the work we chose for a living<br />One day on the grounds we happened upon a handsome, blue haired man<br />The meeting between he and her derailed everything<br />He was the ruler of a country across the ocean, and, loving her deeply,<br />He refused the marriage proposal of a princess in the neighboring country</p>
		<p>The country was engulfed in the horrors of war; the decree the princess made:<br />“All of the green haired women, kill them”</p>
		<p>Everyone, everyone was lost forever<br />Except the white haired me<br />I should have died in her place<br />Why, why?</p>
	</figure>
	<figure id="p03" class="g02 right">
		<p>“I’m sorry for being alive”, before I knew it that was my catchphrase<br />Mine was a dull life of saying nothing but complaints<br />I began my new livelihood in a port city’s church<br />I heard from a rumor on the wind that in the revolution, the princess died<br />I met her, near the church<br />She had collapsed and I saved her; that was the beginning<br />Before I knew it the two of us were getting along well<br />But just about everything between me and her was different</p>
		<p>In the night confessional when no one was around<br />By chance I heard her confession<br />Ah, what does this mean?<br />She is certainly the  -Daughter of Evil-</p>
		<p>At a small harbor on the outskirts of town, she is standing alone<br />From behind I draw near<br />From my breast pocket I took out a knife<br />Pointed it at the princess’ back, and raised it high</p>
		<p>I have an apology I must make to you<br />In the end I didn’t remove your enemy<br />That girl is the old me, a very very solitary person<br />To carry on living by yourself, that’s very lonely</p>
		<p>She who could do nothing<br />Became a little more skillful in her cooking<br />Today’s treat, brioche<br />Is very deliciously baked</p>
		<p>That moment at that beach, for an instant I saw an illusion</p>
		<p>Who in the world was that boy, I wonder?</p>
		<h2>4. The Frog's and My Love Romance</h2>
		<p>One day I fell in love<br />With a small, speckled frog<br />We met at a deep blue colored spring<br />Let’s go together to my castle<br />Can we begin from being friends?<br />Let’s devour a delicious dinner together</p>
		<p>On this beautiful starry night<br />While gazing at the sky let’s talk about our love</p>
		<p>Those big eyes, those wet lips<br />I just love everything about you<br />From now on, let’s always snuggle together<br />And spend time together<br />If you whisper <em>ribbit ribbit</em> to me<br />With that lovely, broken voice<br />Our world will become rose colored</p>
		<p>This is my and your love romance</p>
		<p>One day you disappeared<br />I searched but you weren’t anywhere<br />I desperately cry your name<br />While dragging along my long body<br />I was raspily bawling<br />Will I never be able to see you again?</p>
		<p>Against my instincts<br />I had been looking forward to your growing up</p>
		<p>But those big eyes, those wet lips<br />I just loved everything about you<br />If the time came, I loved you to the point of<br />Wanting to eat you</p>
		<p>In a very sad state<br />I swallowed all of today’s dinner whole<br />Come to think of it, I guess it does resemble you a little</p>
		<p>Before long I might head out to that spring</p>
		<h2>5. The Daughter of Evil ~velvet mix~</h2>
		<p>Once upon a time<br />Reigning at the top<br />Of a fiendish kingdom was<br />A noble girl of age 14<br />Luxurious and splendid furnishings<br />A servant whose face greatly resembled hers<br />A favorite horse named Josephine<br />Everything, everything was hers</p>
		<p>If there wasn’t enough money<br />Choke it from the ignorant masses<br />Those that would oppose me<br />Completely purge them</p>
		<p>“Come, kneel to me!”</p>
		<p>The flower of evil sweetly blooms<br />With brilliant color<br />The pitiful weeds around her<br />Indeed, they’ll turn to nourishment and rot away</p>
		<p>The tyrant princess was in love with<br />A blue man of across the sea<br />Though he fell in love at first sight<br />With a green woman in the neighboring country<br />The princess, mad with jealousy<br />One day summoned her cabinet minister<br />And said in a quiet voice<br />“Send to ruin the kingdom of green”</p>
		<p>Many houses reduced to ashes<br />Many lives disappearing<br />The suffering people’s lamentations<br />Don’t reach the princess</p>
		<p>“Oh, it’s tea time”</p>
		<p>The flower of evil sweetly blooms<br />With maddening color<br />Although it’s a very lovely flower<br />Indeed, there are too many thorns to touch it</p>
		<p>To overthrow the evil princess<br />At last the people rose up<br />Leading the disorderly mob was<br />A female swordsman in red armor<br />Their rage accumulated in conviction<br />Wrapped up the whole country<br />Soldiers tired from the long war<br />Weren’t a threat</p>
		<p>Finally they surrounded the palace<br />The retainers escaped<br />The adorable and lovely princess<br />At last was captured</p>
		<p>“You insolent thug!”</p>
		<p>The flower of evil sweetly blooms<br />With colors that seem sad<br />The paradise for her<br />Indeed will collapse, brittle and transient</p>
		<p>Once upon a time<br />There was a noble girl of age 14<br />Who reigned at the top<br />Of a fiendish kingdom<br />The time of her execution was 3 PM<br />A time when church bells would ring<br />That person who was called princess<br ?>What did they think, alone in jail?</p>
		<p>Finally that time arrived<br />The bells signaling the end ring<br />Without taking notice of the crowd<br />She said</p>
		<p>“Oh, it’s tea time”</p>
		<p>The flower of evil pitifully scatters</p>

			<h2>6. The Servant of Evil ~velvet mix~</h2>
			<p>You are the princess, I am a servant<br />Fate divided, miserable twins<br />I’ll protect you, if it’s for that<br />I will even become evil</p>
			<p>We were born in high expectations<br />Blessed by the church bells<br />By the arbitrary circumstances of adults<br />Our futures were split into two</p>
			<p>Even if all the world<br />Becomes your enemy<br />Because I will protect you<br />You should keep on smiling</p>
			<p>You are the princess, I am a servant<br />Fate divided, miserable twins<br />I’ll protect you, if it’s for that<br />I will even become evil</p>
			<p>While on an outing to the neighboring country<br />In town I happened upon that green haired girl<br />I fell in love at first sight<br />With that kind voice and smile</p>
			<p>But if the princess<br />Asks me to erase that girl<br />I shall answer that<br />Why? These tears won’t stop</p>
			<p>You are the princess, I am a servant<br />Fate divided, maddened twins<br />“Today’s treat is brioche”<br />You laugh, you innocently laugh</p>
			<p>This country may end very soon<br />At the hands of its crazed people<br />If it’s said this is our punishment<br />I shall take it upon myself to oppose it</p>
			<p>“Look, I’ll loan you my clothes”<br />“Wear them and escape immediately”<br />“It’s alright, we’re twins.”<br />“I’m sure no one will know”</p>
			<p>I am the princess, you are a fugitive<br />Fate divided, sorrowful twins<br />If it’s said that you’re evil<br />Then that same blood runs in me too</p>
			<p>Once upon a time<br />I had a very precious sibling<br />Who reigned at the top<br />Of a fiendish kingdom</p>
			<p>Even if all the world<br />Becomes your enemy<br />Because I will protect you<br />Keep smiling somewhere</p>
			<p>You are the princess, I am a servant<br />Fate divided, miserable twins<br />I’ll protect you, if it’s for that<br />I will even become evil</p>
			<p>If only we could be reborn<br />Let’s play again then, okay?</p>
			<h2>7. regret message ~velvet mix~</h2>
			<p>At a small harbor on the outskirts of town is a girl standing alone<br />At this sea there’s a secret tradition from long ago</p>
			<p>“Put in a small bottle your wish written on parchment<br />If it’s set adrift in the sea, one of these days your wish might bear fruit”</p>
			<p>It floats away, a small glass bottle; a message with a wish put in<br />Beyond the horizon it silently disappears</p>
			<p>Although you always did everything for me<br />I was always nothing but selfish and inconvenienced you</p>
			<p>You who granted my wishes for me, because you’re already gone<br />So I will deliver my feelings to this sea</p>
			<p>It floats away, a small wish with tears and a little regret<br />The realization of my sin was always after everything was over</p>
			<p>It floats away, a small glass bottle; a message with a wish put in<br />Beyond the horizon it silently disappears</p>
			<p>It floats away, a small wish; with tears and a little regret<br />“If only we could be reborn<span class="moshimo">”</span></p>

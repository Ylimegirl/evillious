		<p>Project ‘Ma’ was begun to defend against the world’s destruction. It’s hard to say if it was making good progress.</p>
		<p>＊＊＊</p>
		<p class="list">First Project – The ‘Ma’ subject Eve Zvezda failed in birthing the twins. Afterwards the subject disappeared.<br />Second Project – The ‘Witch of Merrigod’, Meta Salmhofer, safely delivered the twins, then afterwards fled while taking them with her. The search for her is ongoing.<br />Third Project – Project stopped midway due to the subject’s death from their frailty.<br />Fourth Project –  Project abandoned due to the subject’s murder by ‘Apocalypse’.<br />Fifth Project – Subject disposed of with due to the children birthed not being twins.<br />Sixth Project – Subject was stolen by her husband, Wei Lucif, during the pregnancy. Her corpse was discovered in the village of Nemu later, but it was determined that the fetuses had vanished.</p>
		<p>＊＊＊</p>
		<p>And in EC 013,</p>
		<p>Four women were selected as candidates for the subject of the seventh Project “Ma”.</p>

		<h2>“Ma” Survival -&nbsp;Who Will Survive?&nbsp;-</h2>
		<h3>Song 1</h3>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>The subjects of the seventh Project ‘Ma’ at a glance:</p>
			<p>◆ Irina Clockworker<br />M=206 O=96 T=83 H=113 E=666 R=153<br />A resident apprentice craftsman in Lighwatch City. Her older brother is the craftsman Kiril Clockworker, known as the “Clockmaker”. Although she has not received any magical training, the results of an examination of all inhabitants by the Royal Research Institute confirms she holds a high density M factor.<br />* As the value of her E factor is abnormally high, she may be an HER. Observation necessary.</p>
			<p>◆ Elluka Chirclatia<br />M=253 O=62 T=92 H=28 E=53 R=63<br />Originally a resident shrine maiden in Lighwatch City. Driven out of the temple for delinquent behavior, she now lives as the assistant of her fiancé, Kiril. She has the highest magic of all the current candidates, but the low level of her other values may be a small cause for concern.<br />* There is information that she’s colluding with the evil god Held. Caution advised.</p>
			<p>◆ Milky Eights<br />M=183 O=163 T=123 H=100 E=199 R=143<br />A resident prostitute in Welvya. There were many who objected to making the woman who was originally a lover of Pale Nöel, the leader of “Apocalypse”, into the “Ma” subject. However, there was also Meta Salmhofer’s past success, so finally the senate decided to make her one of the candidates. Her values are the most balanced.<br />* Because she may be currently involved with “Apocalypse”, she is not allowed to enter the temple until the final selection.</p>
			<p>◆ Ly Li<br />M=150 O=99 T=101 H=89 E=123 R=107<br />A noblewoman residing in Asmouse. The second daughter of Li family head, Irta Li. She does not possess an M factor appropriate for being selected as a “Ma” subject, but it seems the senate was put under political pressure.<br />* Because the Li family is heavily contributing to the current project, particular care was taken towards her treatment, so as to not offend her.</p>

		<p>The children of god aren’t born<br />The children of god aren’t found<br />While someone<br />Must become “mother”<br />While the children of god<br />Must be born</p>
		<p>The maidens gathered in the temple<br />Four girls with different birthplaces and backgrounds<br />Only one can<br />Become “mother”<br />Only one can<br />Become “queen”</p>
		<p>Desire changes these holy women<br />Into fiends<br />They take weapons in their hands,<br />Now surely begins<br />Mutual slaughter</p>
		<p>Survival activates<br />Paranoia outweighs feelings of friendship<br />Is the one laughing behind you<br />Really a friend?</p>
		<p>“She died yesterday<br />Her feet slipped and she fell from a cliff”<br />Perhaps that is a lie</p>
		<p>Who will survive in the end?</p>
		<p>A prostitute drowned in sensuality<br />A noblewoman haughty with arrogance<br />A jealous girl in love with her brother<br />And that brother’s fiancée</p>
		<p>Only the one with the strongest talents<br />Will get everything<br />And endless hatred<br />Wells up in their hearts</p>
		<p>Unending survival<br />The rules of reality outweigh the idea of intrinsic goodness<br />Is the one aiming at my life<br />Really an enemy?</p>
		<p>“She hanged herself<br />Heart afflicted by this ugly conflict”<br />Such a thing is absolutely a lie</p>
		<p class="versebreak">Who will survive in the end?</p>
		<p>Dear sister-in-law,<br />Let’s stop this already<br />The remaining candidates<br />Are just us<br />This is meaningless<br />As for being queen<br />It should be you, dear sister-in-law<br />You who was chosen by my brother</p>
		<p class="versebreak">Thank you, Irina<br />You’re safe<br />I won’t let you die<br />I’ll protect you</p>
		<p class="versebreak">Flowers of blood bloom from her back<br />Sister-in-law fell on the spot<br />What she saw in her dying moment<br />Was the wailing face of her young sister-in-law</p>
		<p class="versebreak">“Sinful girl who by her hands<br />Ended three people,<br />You have been selected<br />As the new ‘Ma’”</p>
		<p>The girl standing at the altar<br />A demon smiling like an angel<br />If she conceived the children<br />With that, peace would come</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, survival<br />Will never be over<br />Right?<br />The sword that aimed at the new queen<br />Gleamed somewhere</p>

		<h2>Whereabouts of the Miracle -&nbsp;CATASTROPHE&nbsp;-</h2>
		<h3>Song 2</h3>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>A man was stricken with despair. The girlfriend he loved had died. Murdered by the little sister he loved.</p>
			<p>＊＊＊</p>
			<p>I wasn’t able to escape from the fate of a ghoul child after all. Those out there with the same appearance as myself are all scattering malice around this country. The outbreak of ‘her’——surely <em>that</em> is the omen of our destruction, isn’t it?</p>
			<p>The sole exceptions to that were myself, and Seth Twiright. In order to save this country, he continues to devote himself to his passions in Project ‘Ma’. But——now even his good will seems questionable. Is Project ‘Ma’ really for the sake of saving our people?</p>
			<p>I thought that at least my little sister was different. She was different from us. Her appearance was different. Her personality was different. So I’d thought it would be alright. She wasn’t a ‘her’ at all. At least that’s what I’d believed.</p>
			<p>A ‘her’ will give birth to the Twins of God? And the world will be saved through that? Is that really so?</p>
			<p>The music box has stopped moving. Its music will never play, now. Or that’s what I’d thought——but my ears can hear it. A melody. No, this is not a tune.</p>
			<p>It’s a voice.</p>
			<p>My own dearly beloved’s voice——</p>
			<p>Oh, dear Elluka. What should I do?</p>
			<p>——I understand. I should take you with me and go there. To the ark in the temple.</p>

		<h3>Song 3</h3>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>Having snuck into the temple, Kiril put Elluka’s corpse in the ark device, ‘Sin’. The sealed and forbidden device allowed the restoration of the dead——and he used it.</p>
			<p>With the ‘Sin’ he carried out Elluka’s resurrection. But directly afterwards the device ran wild. It caused a great explosion. The scale of it extended even to damaging the countries around it, not to mention the entirety of the one it was in.</p>
			<p>That night, people of neighboring nations said that they witnessed an enormous two-headed dragon rising in the Magic Kingdom Levianta’s deep red sky.</p>
			<p>Levianta collapsed. Almost countless scores of super technology——the buried legacy of the ‘Second Period’——was all lost forever.</p>
			<p>Kiril’s whereabouts at the time are unknown. Irina, who had been the candidate for queen, also sustained life-threatening injuries.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, in spite of having been in the heart of the explosion Elluka was unharmed. As a side effect of the ‘Sin’ she acquired perpetual youth and immortality, and the ability to transfer her consciousness to another person——</p>
			<p>The ‘Body Swap’ technique.</p>
			<p>She came to hear the tune of a music box from somewhere——</p>

		<p>The music boxes I made<br />Played with a sound that was<br />More beautiful than anyone else’s<br />The people,<br />Filled with a sense of respect for me,<br />Called me ‘Clockworker’</p>
		<p>A beloved fiancée and<br />A precious younger sister<br />The two were always by my side<br />“I’m the luckiest man in the world”<br />I thanked to god</p>
		<p>For their sakes I would create it,<br />Filled with love for them<br />My extraordinary and superior<br />Music box<br />In the springs<br />I packed my wish<br />That the future we three walked towards<br />Would have great happiness</p>

		<p>In this country, whoever possesses the strongest magic<br />Becomes queen<br />And is chosen to<br />Obtain everything<br />They were selected as candidates for new leader<br />My fiancée and younger sister</p>
		<p>The gears began to go mad<br />The two who came together in hatred<br />If there had been no such thing as magic…<br />It was the worst conclusion; what I saw<br />Was the music box stained in blood</p>

		<p>Elluka disappeared from the ruined Levianta.</p>
		<p>Irina had lost all of her limbs, and her entire body was swollen and red. Even though she had survived, she would likely never be able to become queen now, or give birth to any children.</p>
		<p>Irina swore revenge. She would bestow despair upon the woman——Elluka——who made her take on such a form. She would not allow her happiness. She would snatch away everything that she sought. Even if it took her several hundred years.</p>
		<p>There was someone who approached Irina as she was left behind in the cleared out ruin.</p>
		<p>It was Seth Twiright, the head of Project ‘Ma’.</p>
		<p>He held under his arm a red stuffed cat.</p>
		<p>Behind his back a large full moon shined brilliantly.</p>

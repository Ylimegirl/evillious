	<figure id="p02" class="g02 left">
		<p>There are many mysteries left in the history of “<span class="red">The Daughter of Evil</span>”.</p>
		<p>Lucifenia’s glorious and bloody history.<br />The aggressive war led by <span class="red">King Arth</span> with the goal of uniting all of the Evillious region under one banner, can be said to be its beginning.</p>
		<p>The armies led by the king’s loyal subordinates, the Three Heroes,<br />greatly expanded his small country’s territory in a short period of time. The war was brought to an end by King Arth falling ill,<br />but by that point, Lucifenia had already become the most powerful country in the region.</p>
		<p>After the king’s death, Lucifenia experienced a brief revolt caused by the machinations of its prime minister.<br />One of his candidates for heir, <span class="red">Prince Alexiel</span>, went missing from the public eye.</p>
		<p>Lucifenia’s governance was transferred to Arth’s queen, Anne,<br />but she too wound up dying young from illness just like her husband.</p>
		<p>The only one left was the fourteen-year-old <span class="red">Princess Riliane</span>.<br />She was inexperienced, lacking the charisma of her father and the intelligence of her mother.</p>
		<p>The country smoldered in discontent.<br />The political purges she enacted to bring it under control served only to spark the flames of destruction.</p>
		<p>The assassination of <span class="red">Leonhart</span>, one of the Three Heroes.<br />An invasion against a neighboring country over the princess’ personal grudges.<br />These wound up becoming motivations for the eventual revolution.</p>
		<p>The revolutionary army led by <span class="red">Germaine</span>, Leonhart’s daughter, surged into the palace and captured the princess.<br />The revolutinary army’s fighting strength was poor, being comprised primarily of regular townsfolk, but their attempt was successful.<br />We can posit several key reasons for this.<br />The low morale of the kingdom’s army due to their unnecessary invasion.<br />The loss of the authority of the Three Heroes.<br />And aid given to the revolutionary army from the nearby country of Marlon.</p>
		<p>Amidst the people’s censure, the princess was beheaded in the town square.<br />And in this way, Lucifenia’s brief time of glory met its end.</p>
	</figure>
	<figure id="p03" class="g02 right">
		<p class="versebreak">The country of Marlon attempted to bring Lucifenia under its power through this revolution, and it too wound up following a path of decline due to infighting among the royal family. Marlon’s king <span class="red">Kyle</span> abdicated the throne, and was said to have led a quiet life in another country afterwards.</p>
		<p>……Well now, there are a handful of scholars that dispute accounts such as this in historical textbooks.</p>
		<p>The most well-known differing opinions are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>That it was the princess’ body double who was executed, and the real princess survived after hiding her identity, living to a ripe old age.</li>
			<li>That princess declared the invasion on her neighboring country out of envy towards a <span class="red">diva</span> that was living there, but that diva was actually the apprentice of <span class="red">Elluka</span>, one of the Three Heroes–this was the reason Elluka left the country.</li>
			<li>There are many theories as to who it was that carried out the assassination of Leonhart and the diva. The missing Prince Alexiel, King Kyle Marlon’s illegitimate half-sister, etc. There are theories that both of them worked as the princess’ <span class="red">servants</span> under false identities.</li>
			<li>That King Arth died in an accident when he was young, and that it was a body double who ruled the country after that. In other words, the Lucifenian royal line perished long before the revolution.</li>
			<li>There are many fairy-tale-esque anecdotes regarding Germaine, the hero of the revolution.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>That she wasn’t Leonhart’s true daughter, but rather a descendant of the royal family of Beelzenia, the country of red.</li>
				<li>That she was the one who assassinated the diva in order to stoke the spirit of rebellion in the common people, as well as gain Marlon’s aid.</li>
				<li>That she contracted with a demon, or a <span class="red">witch</span>, and gained a long life, becoming president of the Lucifenian Republic a hundred years later.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>There are grains of truth to be found in many of these theories, and there is also the work of author <span class="red">Yukina Freezis</span>, who was herself involved in more than a few of the events of this time period.<br />However, as she is herself only a fairytale novelist, there are many who repudiate her by arguing that there are a great deal of things that are exaggerated or fabricated in the Freezis authorial record, and that it’s not to be treated as fact.</p>
		<p class="cursive">–We can only pray that this song collection will help to solve some of these mysteries</p>

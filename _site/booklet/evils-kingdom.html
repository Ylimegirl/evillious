			<p>Welcome, to “the forest theater”. Was it “Nice to meet you”, I wonder? Or “Long time no see”? …Either one is fine, when it comes to this.</p>
			<p>I am the one who was once called “Ma”.</p>
			<p>You’ve heard and told that rumor as well, have you? That <em>rumor</em> that a vast inheritance is hidden in the theater. I’ll say before anything else that it isn’t true.</p>
			<p>If you’ve come here with the intention of finding the inheritance, I recommend that you turn right around and run back home as fast as you can.</p>
			<p>But if that isn’t the case… since we have the opportunity, could you watch some films with me?</p>
			<p>While we’re at it, I’ll tell you a little bit about several of the incidents that have occurred here in the Evillious region, and one sorceress.</p>
			<p>Today’s screening is 15 works. I wonder if you’ll like them?</p>

		<p class="keyword">【Original Sin】</p>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>This was around the time this forest was still called “The Forest of Held”…<br />A young married couple of woodcutters lived there. I don’t know the name of her husband, but the wife’s name was… Eve. Yes, Eve Moonlit. I’m pretty sure it was a name like that. She committed “sin” in this forest.</p>
			<p>She clung to the love she had with her husband. She became arrogant for her desires being granted. She neglected the things she had to do and her children died. She was jealous of people who were happy. Eventually that transformed into anger. She came to want what she had lost. And, out of hunger she gathered some fruits.</p>
			<p>That became the beginning of everything.</p>

			<p>Twins who advanced through the forest, led there by their parents. A lone boy,<br />and a lone girl. They simply walked without being told their destination. On a night when the moon had waned.</p>
			<p>I’ve looked over every document I could for the name of the twins introduced in this story, but in the end, I couldn’t find them. Maybe that’s because their existence had been thoroughly concealed by the parents who raised them. Nowadays there’s no way to learn how they could do such a deed, their reasons, or the mental state they were in.</p>
			<p>I wonder, did they really exist to begin with?</p>

		<div class="summary">
			<p>The twins. What was reflected in their eyes as they gazed at their burning<br />family? They released everything, and then disappeared.</p>
			<p>The sorceress. Those days when she was still “Elluka Clockworker” in the true meaning of the name. Having lost everything to the disaster two years before, she was given in its place the “boredom” that could also be called eternity. The request that she received from the god who protected the forest… her friend, “The Tree of Held”, had been just right for filling in that “boredom”.</p>
			<p>It’s very regrettable that close to a thousand years has passed since then, yet she still hasn’t carried out that request.</p>

		<h3>Illustration: Suzunosuke</h3>
		<p class="keyword">【Lust】</p>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>In order to spend her eternal “boredom” pleasantly, Elluka began to need a<br />certain process. This is because, distant and long as it might be when compared to ordinary humans, as something that had a form her body was slowly but surely decaying. To prevent that, she needed to periodically “exchange” her body with a new one. And she’s a woman of course, so perhaps you can appreciate that she wanted an appearance that was always beautiful?</p>
			<p>Sateriasis Venomania…<br />The event that he caused had left deep wounds in the hearts of the women who had been his victims. Lukana Octo was one of them. Her very body had become tainted by a demon… it’s easy to guess that to one as pure as her, that was an unbearable thing.</p>
			<p>For her sake, Elluka took custody of her body and her suffering.</p>

		<h2>V. Evil Food Eater Conchita</h2>
		<h3>Illustration: Ichika</h3>
		<p class="keyword">【Surfeit】</p>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>Even among those that were swayed by the Deadly Sins, Banica Conchita was<br />perhaps one of the more fortunate. Because she enforced her hopes and convictions up until the very end.</p>
			<p>Having obtained the body of Lukana Octo, the search for the Vessels of Deadly Sin became somewhat simpler for Elluka. The magical power of Lust that remained in her body became an aid in that. Even so, this time the twin servants that clung to Banica got in the way of her retrieving the vessel of Gluttony.</p>
			<p>As for why those twins were in the Beelzenian Empire, so far from their birthplace… I can’t say for certain. In my personal opinion, perhaps they saw in Banica a “trace of their mother”.</p>

		<h2 class="kagamine">VI. Twiright Prank</h2>
		<h3>Illustration: Ichika</h3>
		<p class="keyword">【Mischief】</p>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>There were a lot of international disputes in Evillious at the time, and<br />continuous warfare. But to Elluka this was also an era where she could regain her long lost humanity. Because in the height of battle, Elluka had met people that she could call friends.</p>
			<p>Her slight happiness then had been crushed in the moment that she saw the newborns that one of her friends, Anne, had given birth to. Because she’d realized those babies looked identical to another set of abominable twins. And because she’d realized that one of them was being swayed by the deadly sin of Pride.</p>

		<div class="summary">
			<p>Riliane d’Autriche. The Lucifenian princess who was later called “The<br />Daughter of Evil”. When she was very young, Elluka had forcibly torn a deadly sin away from her. It resulted in Riliane losing her memories, but surely that had driven off a great tragedy.</p>
			<p>But that ended up not being so. She committed heinous deeds when she grew up. They ended up provoking the revolt of her people.</p>
			<p>It was nothing more than Elluka’s own error that she couldn’t see how the tentacles of “Sin” extended even to the twin’s younger brother.</p>

		<h2 class="kagamine">VIII. The Servant of Evil</h2>
		<h3>Illustration: Ichika</h3>
		<p class="keyword">【Loyal】</p>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>There’s a history that I expect you’ve learned. It’s not the case that all of it is telling<br />the truth.</p>
			<p>Allen Avadonia was a servant of Princess Riliane. It’s thought that during the Lucifenian revolution he escaped from the palace, his whereabouts afterwards a mystery.</p>
			<p>Allen Avadonia’s name doesn’t appear in textbooks, but he is a figure who yet bears a piece of history.</p>
			<p>But that’s not worth worrying about. To Elluka the important matter was that she couldn’t obtain the vessel of deadly sin, “The Four Mirrors”. To me the important matter is that he did not become one of the gears.</p>

		<h2 class="kagamine">IX. Regret Message</h2>
		<h3>Illustration: Ichika</h3>
		<p class="keyword">【A Spoken Message】</p>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>Traditions, legends, folklore… I wonder how humans can find hope in the<br />works they themselves brought forth? I would think that salvation doesn’t even exist there.</p>
			<p>One night. A lone girl stood by the seaside. She too was someone who clung to that hope by the name of “tradition”.</p>
			<p>Thinking that she had been saved was nothing more than her self-delusion. Even if she set adrift her “guilt”, “sin” certainly isn’t something you can wash away.</p>
			<p>Well, I think it’s probably for the best that she decided not to turn around.</p>

		<div class="summary">
			<p>The story once again begins from the forest. Clarith was a descendent of the<br />Netsuma clan who had been brought up in Elphegort. The tendency to persecute outsiders wounded her tender heart, warping it. She was a powerless person. The pride to have things her own way, the kindness to sacrifice herself for someone, the bravery to resist authority, she didn’t have any of that on hand.</p>
			<p>Held and Elluka’s plan in the end came to grant Clarith’s wish. Had that been a good thing for Clarith, or perhaps not?</p>

			<p>The removed gear. The conclusion to that is in the darkness. The black box<br />was buried in the sand, and probably won’t be found again.</p>
			<p>When the boy awoke, he was inside a black box. Waiting there was darkness and isolation. And a large spring. The days of his atonement begin.</p>

		<div class="summary">
			<p>Around this era, Lukana Octo’s body also began to grow visibly aged, if only a<br />little. For her comfortable Envy, Elluka began to feel a longing to have a new body before too much longer.</p>
			<p>Life in this country that was placed far east from the Evillious region was quite stimulating for her. The tailor Kayo Sudou was a beauty with lovely black hair, but, as it seemed she carried a complex about her appearance due to some curious circumstance, she conversely grew envious of Elluka’s looks. It was at that point that Elluka and Kayo switched bodies. Elluka obtained the Deadly Sin that she’d been burdened with and the scissors that it had occupied. And Kayo obtained Lukana’s body and counterfeit scissors.</p>
			<p>But it was too late. At that time Kayo had already been tainted by “sin”, down to the depths of her soul.</p>

		<h2>XIII. Judgment of Corruption</h2>
		<h3>Illustration: you-ring@Tomotoshi Kitano</h3>
		<p class="keyword">【Greed】</p>
		<div class="summary">
			<p>Our era, where the four allied countries of USE (Union<br />State of Evillious) held hegemony over Evillious. Gallerian Marlon, the worst judge of the Dark Star Bureau in history, used his standing for his own ends, sometimes accepting handsome bribes from nobles who had become defendants, and at other times filling his own pockets by trapping with false charges those who were inconvenient to royal figures.</p>
			<p>Gallerian, who had been my friend. He was also tainted by a “Deadly Sin”. I had, conversely, intended to try putting that to good use. Following my predictions, he collected many “vessels” for me.</p>
			<p>The storage area where he kept his “collection pieces”… Yes, that’s this very theater that we are in now.</p>

			<p>Of the seven Vessels of the Deadly Sin, we’ve collected five. …Right now let’s<br />determine beforehand that there are five. It seems there is one who is yet sleeping, and one whose original purpose I’ve forgotten. …Huh? Who the hell… am I? That too? I am “Ma”. No more, no less.</p>
			<p>If you say you want to know my true identity, shall we also play a word game? It appears that the selfish girl has hidden the five vessels somewhere in this theater as a prank. Those five, and the green gear that the director carries around. Six in all. Could you collect them for me? There is a “seal” engraved on the six vessels. After that apply the word derived from them—</p>

		<h2>01, Judgment of Corruption</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>A disgraced administration of justice<br />With charges decided by the defendant’s wealth<br />As the master of the court<br />I desire money more than justice</p>
			<p>Even if you’re a scoundrel<br />If you pay money I’ll save you<br />Money is the best lawyer in Hell</p>
			<p>Appearance and age, race and gender<br />All of it’s irrelevant<br />The most important thing is if you can pay money<br />That’s all there is to it</p>
			<p>Your life depends on me<br />If you want help, show me the money</p>
			<p>Yes, your sins are my consideration alone<br />Judgment of corruption<br />If you want rescue from a swamp of false charges<br />Hand over more money</p>
			<p>For the sake of my disabled daughter, too<br />I need money<br />If I collect the seven vessels of grave sin<br />My wish will come true</p>
			<p>Today too in the unfolding courtroom of doubt<br />The wicked laugh, the innocent cry</p>
			<p>Yes, your sins are my consideration alone<br />Judgment of corruption<br />If it’s to grant my own dearest wish<br />I will continue to swing this unjust mallet</p>
			<p>A vicious general is a mass murderer<br />A capital crime charge is natural<br />I was handed a bribe, and I<br />Declare the defendent innocent</p>
			<p>In the resulting rage, a civil war began<br />The general was killed<br />His miserable corpse is exposed on the field</p>
			<p>The force of the anger comes to face me<br />And my house blazes<br />My beloved “daughter”<br />If we two are together, I have nothing to fear</p>
			<p>From the burned down mansion, they’ll probably find<br />The remains of a solitary “parent and child”…</p>
			<p>This place where I was alone when I opened my eyes<br />Is the gate of the Hellish Yard<br />Heaven or hell, that is decided by<br />The Master of the Hellish Yard</p>
			<p>Even if you’re a scoundrel<br />If you pay money I’ll save you<br />Money is the best lawyer in Hell</p>
			<p>I smile at the Master of the Hellish Yard<br />And softly whisper</p>
			<p>“I will never hand over my fortune to the likes of you”</p>
			<p>I jumped through the door and my body<br />Falls right down to the bottom of hell</p>
			<p>Yes, sins are my consideration alone<br />Judgment of corruption<br />No matter who it is, I won’t approve<br />Anyone judging this sin of mine</p>
			<p>Yes, one day I will again gather in my hands<br />The fragments of deadly sin<br />In that moment, hell may turn into<br />Me and my daughter’s utopia…</p>

		<h2>02, Chrono Story</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Is that the song of birds that I can hear?<br />No, that is the cry of the forest<br />Is that the light of the moon that’s shining?<br />No, that’s the burning fire</p>
			<p>The person we used to call “mother”<br />Turns to ashes inside the stove<br />The “Original Sin” that remained afterwards<br />We divided into seven with our own hands</p>
			<p>“Lust”, is the flower<br />“Gluttony”, is the seed<br />“Pride”, is the stone<br />“Envy”, is the spring<br />“Sloth”, is the wind<br />“Greed”, is the dirt<br />And,<br />“Wrath”, is the forest</p>
			<p>Fly away, seven sins<br />The impurity born from our false mother<br />Let the world turn and turn<br />This evil, grave sin<br />Purify it</p>
			<p>By the hands of the forbidden fruit<br />The seven sins were released into the world<br />The tree of Held, who protects the forest,<br />Requests his friend to collect them all</p>
			<p>“I don’t mind if it kills some time”<br />“’Cause my time is infinite anyhow”<br />The sorceress sneers</p>
			<p>The eternity she was granted<br />At the end of having lost the one she loved<br />And destroyed what was precious<br />To her was nothing but emptiness</p>
			<p>The sorceress who obtained everything<br />And then lost it<br />What does she wish for?<br />What does she seek?<br />To the end of time…</p>
			<p>Born and raised from a lone woman<br />The story of such a sin cut into seven<br />The capricious whim of a witch who transcends time<br />This Chrono Story that begins from the forest</p>

		<h2>03, Recollective Musicbox</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>A music box with golden springs that warped<br />The unplaying melody is a song of love<br />A music box that disappeared in the shadow of history<br />A jeweled box that won’t be opened</p>
			<p>The music boxes he made played with a sound that was<br />More beautiful than anyone else’s<br />The people, filled with a sense of respect for him,<br />Called him “Clockworker”</p>
			<p>A beloved fiancée and a precious younger sister<br />“I am a lucky man”, he thanked god</p>
			<p>For their sakes he would create it, filled with love<br />An extraordinary, peerless music box<br />In the music box he packed his wish<br />For their future then on to have great happiness</p>
			<p>Now the music box won’t play anymore</p>
			<p>In this country, whoever possesses the strongest magical talent<br />Will become ruler, and obtain everything<br />The ones selected as candidates for new leader were<br />The fiancée and younger sister</p>
			<p>The gears began to go mad, those two who came together in hatred<br />Could have lived together in harmony, if there was no such thing as magic</p>
			<p>It was the worst conclusion; what he saw<br />Was the music box he built stained in blood<br />The fallen woman and the wailing woman<br />Both were loved, loved and yet</p>
			<p>Now the music box won’t play anymore</p>
			<p>A place that used to have a country is now a ruin<br />An old man who’s lost his sanity is making something<br />Travelers enquired as to what he’s making<br />The old man replies that it’s a music box</p>
			<p>But it<br />Was a dirty black box<br />That just looks like simple trash</p>

		<h2>04, Madam Merry-Go-Round</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Welcome to this happy country,<br />I’ll undo the chains that bind you hand and foot<br />A ferris wheel, haunted house,<br />And just for tonight, yes, a slave for you</p>
			<p>If you’re worn from playing, come here,<br />Inside a cold cradle</p>
			<p>Madam Merry-Go-Round, queen of the amusement park<br />Madam Merry-Go-Round, a shackled host<br />A transient utopia seen from on top of the wooden horse</p>
			<p>Madam Merry-Go-Round, even if the world is destroyed<br />Madam Merry-Go-Round, I will be here<br />You should go around now, and completely forget everything</p>
			<p>If you want your wish granted,<br />Get in line, wait your turn<br />The shining shadow parade,<br />Their eyes on the end, will keep on through thick and thin</p>
			<p>These midnight games;<br />The one desiring them<br />Isn’t me, it’s you</p>
			<p>Madam Merry-Go-Round, a beauty resembling someone<br />Madam Merry-Go-Round, those forgotten memories<br />A genial warmth she embraced with white hands</p>
			<p>Madam Merry-Go-Round, even if you’re in love<br />Madam Merry-Go-Round, it’s a dream bound to one night<br />A vow exchanged between the two that wasn’t kept that day</p>
			<p>Madam Merry-Go-Round, queen of the amusement park<br />Madam Merry-Go-Round, a shackled host<br />A transient utopia seen from on top of the wooden horse</p>
			<p>Madam Merry-Go-Round, even if the world is destroyed<br />Madam Merry-Go-Round, I will be here<br />Even if you can’t go back home, don’t blame me, okay?</p>

		<h2>05, Wendy</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Peter Pan arrived at my side</p>
			<p>Stuck to her desk,<br />She scribbled down her delusions in a letter<br />Next to that she said,<br />How can people seem to fly through the sky?</p>
			<p>The moon was waned enough to look funny<br />Facing there, I jumped out the window</p>
			<p>Because I believed that I could soar through the sky<br />Even without wings, I wasn’t afraid<br />With both hands spread I took in the wind<br />Where will I go? Higher, higher</p>
			<p>Peter Pan arrived at my side</p>
			<p>People are like trash<br />What I saw from way too high up in the sky<br />Was a RED LIGHT<br />Going towards somewhere with incredible speed</p>
			<p>Along with the troubles of my heart I’d been carrying,<br />Everything was as small as it was sad</p>
			<p>Because I believed that I could soar through the sky<br />Even without wings, I wasn’t afraid<br />As I was then, I didn’t realize<br />Everyone was laughing somewhere</p>
			<p>Peter Pan isn’t anywhere, I’m alone</p>
			<p>In my room with the lights off<br />A flower was blooming on the desk</p>
			<p>Because I believed that I could soar through the sky<br />Even without wings, I wasn’t afraid<br />I turned to people wearing black clothes<br />And waved my hand; see ya, bye-bye!</p>
			<p>Papa, Mama, please, don’t you cry too</p>

		<h2>06, Desert BLUEBIRD</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>In the world buried in sand<br />We’ve been searching for the blue bird<br />Even though it’s painful, if I’m with you<br />Surely it can be overcome</p>
			<p>In this world with civilization destroyed<br />Before us siblings an old woman appeared with a favor<br />“In order to save the world, I want you to<br />Locate the blue bird”</p>
			<p>That’s the desert BLUE BIRD<br />Suddenly we were entrusted with the fate of the world<br />Packing our hopes in the car<br />Our journey began</p>
			<p>Blue bird, that’s a legend<br />A miracle that could grant every wish<br />After a long journey, we discovered<br />The blue bird’s location</p>
			<p>An enormous, crumbled building<br />There were people who feared that it shouldn’t be walked in<br />For the sake of the hesitant me, you<br />Ran in alone</p>
			<p>If something happened, my timid little sister<br />Would always tremble at my back<br />Packing courage into your heart<br />You enter the building</p>
			<p>In the world buried in sand<br />You discovered it, the blue bird<br />In your arms, with your eyes shut,<br />You won’t be waking up again</p>
			<p>A facility polluted with “nuclear radiation”<br />What I had lost was too much<br />I wished to the blue bird</p>
			<p>Your eyes open once again<br />The blue bird vanished somewhere</p>
			<p>I walked with you beyond then<br />We finally reached the far end of the world<br />There was a blue and vast…<br />Ocean</p>
			<p>Everything will begin from here<br />We’ll rebuild the world with our own hands<br />Even though it’s painful, if I’m with you<br />Surely it can be overcome</p>

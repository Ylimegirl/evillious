			<p>With good fortune, or rather bad fortune, the intruders who escape from the demonic hands of the “Master of the Graveyard” and the “Servants” are arranged to receive the judgment of the new “Master of the Court” in the courtroom prepared in the theater’s great hall</p>

			<p>Even though he’s called the “Gardener”, they needed someone like a handyman so Gammon was forced to do various jobs for the unskilled “inhabitants”</p>
			<p>At times, he also helped “Ma” with her screenplays; Gammon had an innate power, the “Purple Dream”… it seems his prognostic ability became an aid in drawing up screenplays</p>
			<p>In the process of working on those screenplays, Gammon was able to learn just a little about his own ancestor and the reasons for the curse afflicting himself</p>

		<h2>Five Minutes Before Court</h2>
		<p>Here we’ll take note of the 10 matters that we’ll be dealing with in the courtroom this time.</p>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>• master of the court<br />The Defendant: None/<br />A soliloquy by the new Master of the Court, “The Director Doll”.</p>
			<p>• Chrono Story<br />The Defendant: Elluka Clockworker/<br />Matter number CL5. Relating to the secret agreement between a god and a sorceress in the year 015. There are some saying it’s not especially important regarding Held’s current state of having left, but this is certainly a principal event regarding the origins of this theater.</p>
			<p>• Recollective Musicbox<br />The Defendant: Kiril Clockworker (Testimony from Elluka Clockworker)/<br />Related to the “Levianta Catastrophe” in Year 013. This event is as yet still mysterious in its entirety, but testimony has been obtained that will become very important here onward. Due to this we might be able to grasp some information on the missing “Clockworker”.</p>
			<p>• Tree Maiden ~Millenium Wiegenlied~<br />The Defendant: Michaela/<br />The cause relating to the “Lucifenian Revolution” from 500 years prior. We’ll deliberate over Michaela being kin to the god of Held. Because we’ll need to pay attention to her movements, as there’s the possibility that Michaela, as Held’s kin, will interfere with the theater in some form or another.</p>
			<p>• gift from the Princess Who Brought Sleep<br />The Defendant: Margarita Blankenheim/<br />We’ll be inspecting the incident that occurred in Toragay, Elphegort. Everything began from the wedding of a doctor’s daughter and an aristocrat. It’s confirmed that this event was influenced by the organization “Pere Noël”.</p>
			<p>• Fifth Pierrot<br />The Defendant: Lemy Abelard/<br />Though he is a figure involved in the “Rolled Serial Murders” of Year 610, hereafter that will not be alluded to in this court. In the “Duel of Merrigod Plateau” committed by Lemy’s mother “Julia”, the leader of “Pere Noël”, in Year 611, it is confirmed that the defendant was a member of “Pere Noël”.</p>
			<p>• Madam Merry-Go-Round<br />The Defendant: Unknown/<br />Let’s begin deliberations of one of the facts brought about as entertainment by the Gardener’s “Purple Dream”. The Gardener testifies that this is “One of the possible futures of the Director Doll”, though the credibility of this is doubtful.</p>
			<p>• Judgment of Corruption<br />The Defendant: Gallerian Marlon/<br />About matters corning both this and the “Leviantan Civil War” in Year 983. The things it reveals about the founder of the theater and former “Master of the Court”, Gallerian, will hopefully bring about a very worthwhile outcome in this court.</p>
			<p>• Capriccio Farce<br />The Defendant: None/<br />Matter number CL6.<br />Come, let’s begin this farce called a trial!</p>
			<p>• Red Shoe Parade<br />This tune has been prepared as an exit number for adjourning court. We want you to become adequately skillful in your march to hell.</p>

			<h3>―Successor of the court―</h3>
			<p>Due to the “Marlon Spoon” becoming a gear of the clocktower, the Director Doll’s burns disappeared, and she obtained a new power. But the purposeless power began a meaningless rampage. She’s become a means by which visitors receive nothing but the death sentence. There is no ill will in her. She’s just making believe that she’s her beloved “Father”…</p>

		<h2>Chrono Story</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Is that the song of birds that I can hear?<br />No, that is the cry of the forest<br />Is that the light of the moon that’s shining?<br />No, that’s the burning fire</p>
			<p>The person we used to call “mother”<br />Turns to ashes inside the stove<br />The “Original Sin” that remained afterwards<br />We divided into seven with our own hands</p>
			<p>“Lust”, is the flower<br />“Gluttony”, is the seed<br />“Pride”, is the stone<br />“Envy”, is the spring<br />“Sloth”, is the wind<br />“Greed”, is the dirt<br />And,<br />“Wrath”, is the forest</p>
			<p>Fly away, seven sins<br />The impurity born from our false mother<br />Let the world turn and turn<br />This evil, grave sin<br />Purify it</p>
			<p>By the hands of the forbidden fruit<br />The seven sins were released into the world<br />The tree of Held, who protects the forest,<br />Requests his friend to collect them all</p>
			<p>“I don’t mind if it kills some time”<br />“’Cause my time is infinite anyhow”<br />The sorceress sneers</p>
			<p>The eternity she was granted<br />At the end of having lost the one she loved<br />And destroyed what was precious<br />To her was nothing but emptiness</p>
			<p>The sorceress who obtained everything<br />And then lost it<br />What does she wish for?<br />What does she seek?<br />To the end of time…</p>
			<p>Born and raised from a lone woman<br />The story of such a sin cut into seven<br />The capricious whim of a witch who transcends time<br />This Chrono Story that begins from the forest</p>

			<h3>―Clockwork lullaby 5―</h3>
			<p>“Hänsel” and “Gretel”, who had murdered their adoptive parents “Adam” and “Eve”. “Eve” became the personification of the Seven Deadly Sins, the “Original Sinner”, and the twins disappeared. Requested to do so by the forest’s guardian spirit, “Held”, the sorceress “Elluka” set out on a journey to collect them all… so it says. It’s a little complicated with all the characters, I think.</p>

		<h2>Recollective Musicbox</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>A music box with golden springs that warped<br />The unplaying melody is a song of love<br />A music box that disappeared in the shadow of history<br />A jeweled box that won’t be opened</p>
			<p>The music boxes he made played with a sound that was<br />More beautiful than anyone else’s<br />The people, filled with a sense of respect for him,<br />Called him “Clockworker”</p>
			<p>A beloved fiancée and a precious younger sister<br />“I am a lucky man”, he thanked god</p>
			<p>For their sakes he would create it, filled with love<br />An extraordinary, peerless music box<br />In the music box he packed his wish<br />For their future then on to have great happiness</p>
			<p>Now the music box won’t play anymore</p>
			<p>In this country, whoever possesses the strongest magical talent<br />Will become ruler, and obtain everything<br />The ones selected as candidates for new leader were<br />The fiancée and younger sister</p>
			<p>The gears began to go mad, those two who came together in hatred<br />Could have lived together in harmony, if there was no such thing as magic</p>
			<p>It was the worst conclusion; what he saw<br />Was the music box he built stained in blood<br />The fallen woman and the wailing woman<br />Both were loved, loved and yet</p>
			<p>Now the music box won’t play anymore</p>
			<p>A place that used to have a country is now a ruin<br />An old man who’s lost his sanity is making something<br />Travelers enquired as to what he’s making<br />The old man replies that it’s a music box</p>
			<p>But it<br />Was a dirty black box<br />That just looks like simple trash</p>

			<h3>―Clockwork requiem―</h3>
			<p>To go back 2 years before the private meeting between “Held” and “Elluka”:</p>
			<p>The clockmaker, Kiril Clockworker. His tragedy was that his fiancée, Elluka, and his little sister, Irina, both carried great magical power. In their fight over who would obtain the position of holy leader… it goes without saying which of them won. But as to whether or not the one who was defeated vanished from history… I wouldn’t know. I guess there isn’t anything to do but wait until she eventually talks about it personally.</p>

		<h2>Tree Maiden ~Millennium Wiegenlied~</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>“I’m sorry for being alive”<br />The girl who always complained<br />Her white hair different from the people of the village<br />She knelt by the millennium tree deep in the forest<br />And made a wish, “I want a friend”</p>
			<p>I wanted to<br />Grant her wish<br />But I can’t do it with this body<br />At such a time, the<br />Whimsical sorceress who had appeared<br />Reincarnated the spirit me into a human</p>
			<p>I don’t yet know<br />Anything of the world outside the forest<br />So I don’t understand<br />Why is she crying?</p>
			<p>It’s peaceful and boring<br />Although I’d expect that to be a wonderful thing<br />But I don’t understand<br />Why are you crying?</p>
			<p>Between our dreams, our races, and our values<br />The two of us who differ so have now met</p>
			<p>Let this millennium vow resound to the end of the earth<br />A wiegenlied<br />Fastened to a fate of ruin<br />I’m different from you, but I’m drawn to you<br />I’ll protect you, so stay by my side</p>
			<p>My spirit self changes into the human me<br />If I have this body<br />I might be able to understand you</p>
			<p>A life in a new city<br />Makes my heart tremble<br />Wherever kind of place we are<br />If the two of us are together, it’s alright</p>
			<p>The delight of living as a human<br />Little by little I was beginning to understand</p>
			<p>Let this millennium vow resound across the sky<br />A wiegenlied<br />Fastened to a fate of ruin<br />As the two of us change, it might be lonesome, but<br />If I can see your smile, it’ll be okay</p>
			<p>At an evening dinner party I met the ruler of a country over the sea<br />This fate of ruin<br />Began to stir from there</p>
			<p>Loving me, he rejects the marriage proposal of a neighboring country’s princess<br />The blaze of her anger wraps the country in war</p>
			<p>The two of us become separated<br />And now, I understand my feelings towards you</p>
			<p>Let this millennium vow resound to your side<br />Even if I can’t return to being a spirit<br />I won’t be swaying from this decision I’ve made anymore<br />“I am in love with you”</p>
			<p>Even if all the people in the world<br />(Even if all the people in the world)<br />Scorned and mocked you<br />(Scorned and mocked me)<br />Because I will protect you<br />(There’s a someone who needs me)<br />You should always be smiling<br />(With only that I was happy)</p>
			<p>If you can survive to safety<br />And if the day comes we can meet again<br />Let’s live in harmony together in the forest<br />Because I’ll be waiting here no matter what</p>
			<p>The dark bottom of the well, the moon that’s beautiful in the night sky<br />The knife stuck deep in my chest<br />My golden haired assassin departs somewhere<br />The cruel truth is in darkness</p>
			<p>Transparent white hair, clumsy smile<br />Somehow, somehow live on, keep alive<br />If only I could see you<br />I had things I wanted to convey to you<br />If only I could be reborn<br />If I could be reborn…</p>

			<h3>―Spirit of ELD―</h3>
			<p>The sorceress Elluka had made Michaela, who used to be a spirit that served Held, be reborn as a human. She’d probably intended to use her to gather the vessels of deadly sin. The Michaela in question was friendly with a white haired girl. …Or were they in love…? Though it seems that was inevitably doomed.</p>

		<h2>gift from the Princess who Brought Sleep</h2>

			<p>Sleep with this gift, you’ll sleep well with this gift<br />Yes I am the sleep princess, for the sake of your happiness…</p>
			<p>It was a marriage decided by the result of politics<br />Nevertheless I loved you</p>
			<p>You’re an incompetent playboy wallowing in desire<br />But I loved you from before</p>
			<p>You’re only after the wealth of a doctor’s daughter<br />Aside from that I’m happy, nonetheless</p>
			<p>You can also forget our promise when we were children<br />If I can be by your side</p>
			<p>For you who is troubled by anxious feelings<br />I have a very good medicine<br />You can have pleasant dreams, so your worn body can be healed<br />It’s a present from me</p>
			<p>Sleep with this medicinal gift, you’ll sleep well with this medicinal gift<br />Yes I am the sleep princess, for the sake of your happiness…</p>
			<p>Everyone carries troubles<br />My dad, my mom, and the people of this town<br />For the sake of everyone who can’t sleep at night<br />I’ll make this gift, a sleeping medicine</p>
			<p>Unpleasant reality, unrequited feelings<br />If inside a dream, these things can be forgotten<br />Like a baby inside their crib<br />With your eyes closed, abandon yourself</p>
			<p>Everyone swallowed my gift<br />And became happy, each and every one<br />As the only one who can’t sleep, I instead<br />Obtained freedom and riches</p>
			<p>Sleep with this poisonous gift, you will sleep well with this poisonous gift<br />Yes I am the sleep princess, a woman who sought hope</p>
			<p>In those days where I was only used like a decorative doll<br />I was already broken long ago, I wanted to destroy everything</p>
			<p>It’s a very efficacious medicine, efficacious up to being able to sleep forever<br />With this, finally I too will be able to sleep, from the Sleep Princess to Sleeping Princess…</p>

			<h3>―Belphegor’s gift―</h3>
			<p>The one who had gifted the “Clockworker’s Doll”… the director doll… to the wife of Blankenheim had been the woman called Julia, who was a close friend of hers. I’d wager that “gift” was secretly concealed and dispersed inside the doll’s body. Julia was likely the person who created the doll as well. You might say she was the director doll’s true parent. And with that name, “Clockworker’s Doll”… Isn’t the truth somewhat more visible? If I were to make a bold hypothesis, perhaps the wife of Blankenheim was an incarnation of the demon that was intentionally brought about. …Though as a note, it wasn’t my role to be the attorney.</p>

			<p>The boy who played fool<br />With a painted white face<br />Thrusts<br />A silver knife<br />In a fat pig</p>

			<p>With kind and dark eyes<br />Seventh Magician<br />Sweetly tempted him<br />To escape from here</p>

			<h3>―The end of Hänsel―</h3>
			<p>“Hänsel” and “Gretel” released the Seven Deadly Sins into the world, with no details on their whereabouts afterwards. But it appears as though somehow or another with a form that was reincarnated they would appear every few centuries into the latest epoch. Moreover, it seems as though Hänsel, who had been reborn into this era as “Lemy”, didn’t have any memories remaining of his past life. And it seems that he’d also been separate from Gretel, who was usually always with him. Unluckily for him, he was attacked by the sorceress and her apprentice, and then… Bye-bye. Incidentally, as the “Servants” always causing a ruckus in the theater are mere phantoms born from the residual consciousness dwelling in the “Glass of Conchita”, they are nothing more than copies based off of Hänsel and Gretel. They also resemble that selfish girl… the “Waiter”, although she’s someone else. What happened to the originals, I wonder… I guess we don’t have any choice but to ask the Master of the Hellish Yard, hm?</p>

			<p>In the resulting rage, a civil war began<br />The general was killed<br />His miserable corpse is exposed on the field</p>
			<p>The force of the anger comes to face me<br />And my house blazes<br />My beloved “daughter”<br />If we two are together, I have nothing to fear</p>
			<p>From the burned down mansion, they’ll probably find<br />The remains of a solitary “parent and child”…</p>
			<p>This place where I was alone when I opened my eyes<br />Is the gate of the Hellish Yard<br />Heaven or hell, that is decided by<br />The Master of the Hellish Yard</p>
			<p>Even if you’re a scoundrel<br />If you pay money I’ll save you<br />Money is the best lawyer in Hell</p>
			<p>I smile at the Master of the Hellish Yard<br />And softly whisper</p>
			<p>“I will never hand over my fortune<br />To the likes of you”</p>
			<p>I jumped through the door and my body<br />Falls right down to the bottom of hell</p>
			<p>Yes, sins are my consideration alone<br />Judgment of corruption<br />No matter who it is, I won’t approve<br />Anyone judging this sin of mine</p>
			<p>Yes, one day I will again gather in my hands<br />The fragments of deadly sin<br />In that moment, hell may turn into<br />Me and my daughter’s<br />Utopia...</p>

			<h3>―Mammon’s court―</h3>
			<p>It seems as though the temperament of the corrupt judge Gallerian has been inherited not by the “Marlon Spoon” collection piece but rather the “Director Doll”. Is the being currently dwelling in the spoon that’s become “Gear” the dying wish of “Adam” after all? If he’s been protecting against the world’s collapse as a piece of a vessel for close to 1000 years it’s a touching effort, but…</p>
			<p>I’ve heard that “Ma” is the one who fanned Gallerian’s flames, but I don’t think this act is much like her.</p>

		<h2>Capriccio Farce</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>An empty defendant’s seat, a visitor’s gallery with nothing but junk<br />Come, let’s begin this farce called a trial</p>
		<hr />
		<p>master of the court<br />“Only one of the vessels that we’re seeking out by orders of god remains<br />If it’s the case you know its whereabouts<br />Make your testimony, ‘Sorceress of Time’”</p>
		<p>Ma<br />“Transcending time, changing forms, changing masters, it’s already making its debut on stage<br />Even so, not knowing the whereabouts myself right now,<br />I fear it’s likely that it’s in her hands”</p>
		<p>servants<br />“Search, search, search for that jerk<br />Left, right, or down<br />She who holds all the keys<br />Search for the ‘Master of the Hellish Yard’”</p>
		<p>gear<br />“How long is this farce going to continue?<br />There is nothing after that”</p>
		<p>master of the graveyard<br />“Soul of Adam who fell in the trap<br />There’s nothing you can accomplish anymore”</p>
		<p>Swinging scales, a disordered scenario,<br />Vessels sullied in sin; each playing their song their own way, a discordant capriccio<br />The story has already let go of the hands of demons and gods and walks alone<br />If they were in this place, they would probably make this lament:</p>
		<p>――What was truly terrifying<br /><span class="right-text">Was the desire of humanity――</span></p>
		<hr />
		<p>master of the court<br />“Let’s sort what few facts we have,<br />Lowly man descended from a demon<br />I’ll give you permission, so tell us<br />Of the time you came to this forest”</p>
		<p>gardener<br />“There is an unpleasant curse dwelling in my body<br />Seeking my original ancestor’s sword that has become necessary to solve this,<br />I arrived at this forest alone”</p>
		<p>(Kill him, eat him, if we can’t, arrest him<br />This insolent fool who entered the forest)<br />(Judge, judge, at any rate judge him<br />Trial! Sentence! Death!)</p>
		<p>gardener<br />“When I resolved myself after I was arrested<br />The fickle girl extended her hand”</p>
		<p>waiter<br />“I wanted a charge right for doing chores”</p>
		<p>gardener<br />“And so I became the ‘Gardener’”</p>
		<hr />
		<p>‘Sorceress of Time’ ‘Cursed Gardener’<br />Substitutes for the unawakened vessels<br />Each keeping their goals close to the chest<br />Unsettling invaders</p>
		<p>‘Director Doll’, ‘Master of the Graveyard’, ‘Gear’<br />‘Waiter’, ‘Master of the Hellish Yard’<br />When the end of everything arrives<br />Who will be laughing, I wonder?</p>
		<p>――Lulila lulila lulilulila<br /><span class="right-text">The resounding beat of Irregular――</span></p>
		<p>Friendship, trauma, justice, illusion<br />Hope, destruction, dreams, greed, love, death<br />All of it continues to melt and turn<br />The Clockwork Lullaby<br />Just before the solitary man’s death<br />He constructed a theater<br />Will the utopia he wished for<br />Be completed?</p>
		<p>Come, let’s see with our own eyes, this farce called life</p>

		<h2>Red Shoe Parade</h2>
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Now advance on! A shadow parade<br />Wearing matching red shoes<br />Madly dancing as though broken<br />Aim for the end, through thick and thin</p>
			<p>The morning road is full of dangers<br />A bad thief obstructs our path<br />Before he steals, steal from him<br />In the name of our great righteousness</p>
			<p>If we keep on walking, our stomachs will diminish too<br />A bad thief has a home<br />Steal his amassed feast<br />In the name of our great righteousness</p>
			<p>Carrying a moon-shaped crest of arms on our backs,<br />Our red footsteps resound</p>
			<p>Now advance on! A shadow parade<br />Wearing matching red shoes<br />Madly dancing as though broken<br />Aim for the end, through thick and thin</p>
			<p>Yearning for people in the pattern of the sunset<br />A bad thief has a family<br />Console both the heart and body<br />In the name of our great righteousness</p>
			<p>The rain drizzles on the melancholy night,<br />A bad thief was laughing<br />Slaughter him, we’re jealous<br />In the name of our great righteousness</p>
			<p>Praise us, this unending march<br />Our iron footsteps resound</p>
			<p>Now advance on! A shadow parade<br />Wearing matching iron collars<br />While we laugh as though broken<br />Aim for the end, through thick and thin</p>
			<p>The suddenly echoed sound of a whistle<br />Signaled the end of our journey</p>
			<p>Time passed, and one day<br />From the dark room we went out into the light<br />So once again the journey begins</p>
			<p>Now advance on! A shadow parade<br />Wearing matching red shoes<br />The people down the road see us<br />And laugh, and cry</p>
			<p>Our steps are hot as though burning<br />These red shoes are different than the usual<br />When we realized the true meaning of that<br />The shadow parade burned out</p>
			<p>You said it was “punishment”</p>

			<h3>―Shadow parade―</h3>
			<p>From the Freezis Fairytale, “Red Shoe Parade”</p>
			<p>I don’t have faith in people who loudly call for justice. How many weak people are shedding tears in the background of worthless heroism?</p>
			<p>If you want to scorn me as “evil” you’re welcome to do so.</p>
			<p>Better that than the likes of you bastards.</p>

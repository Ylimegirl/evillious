The majority of the information in the timelines has been collected myself via archive scouring, and if you have any additional sources for anything I've missed I'd appreciate it being sent my way.

		<p>I render my YouTube videos in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_After_Effects">After Effects</a>, and I do not monetize them. The majority of them have been copyright claimed by <a href="http://originalcreator.net">original creator</a>, meaning that ad revenue from those go to mothy through them. I remove my videos when mothy uploads an official version to his YouTube, and don't upload off-vocals.</p>

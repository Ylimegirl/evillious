	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The PV was illustrated by Ichika.</li>
        <li>mothy <a href="http://mothy.blog39.fc2.com/blog-entry-194.html">wrote</a> that he spelled the English's song title as Twiright instead of Twilight because of the duality of the characters' VOCALOIDs, Kagamine <strong>R</strong>in and <strong>L</strong>en, as well as a pormanteau of "twist" and "right".</li>
        <li>The song was originally composed for a fanmade <em>The Daughter of Evil</em> musical adaption.</li>
        <li>While the lyrics in the album booklets use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji">kanji</a>, the PV's subtitles exclusively use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana">hiragana</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana">katakana</a>.</li>
        <li>The secret the demon tells Allen is the one used by Riliane in <a href="{% link song/regret-message.html %}"><em>regret message</em></a>.</li>
        <li>A silhouetted figure resembling the master of the graveyard from <a href="{% link song/heartbeat-clocktower.html %}"><em>Heartbeat Clocktower</em></a> is visible in the PV.</li>
        <li>The niconico upload is described as "'The Daughter of Evil' and 'the Servant of Evil'. A small memory of the so-called twins when they were young."</li>
        <li>mothy's <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/mylist/45263307">official playlist</a> lists the song as occuring in EC 491 and describes it as "An incident during the youth of the Lucifenian princess and prince."</li>
